THE FORTY-SEUENTH NOUELL.</a></h3>

<p class = "summary">
A gentleman called Galgano, long time made sute to Madonna Minoccia: her
husband sir Stricca (not knowing the same) diuers times praised and
commended Galgano, by reason whereof, in the absence of her husband, she
sent for him, and yelded herself vnto him, tellinge him what wordes her
husbande had spoken of him, and for recompence he refused to dishonest
her.</p>


<p><span class = "firstletter">I</span>n the Citie of Siena in Italie
there was a rich yong Gentleman called Galgano, borne of noble birth,
actiue, and wel trained in al kinde of exercise, valiaunt, braue, stoute
and curteous, in the maners and orders of all countries verye skilfull.
This Galgano loued a Gentlewoman of Siena named Madonna Minoccia, the
wyfe of sir Stricca a comely knight, and wore in his apparell the colour
and deuises of his Lady, bearing the same vppon his helmet and armour,
in all Iustes, Tourneyes and triumphes, obseruing noble feastes and
banquettes for her sake. But for all those costly, sumptuous and noble
practises, this Lady Minoccia in no wyse would giue eare vnto his sutes.
Wherfore Galgano at his wittes ende, was voyde of aduise what to do or
saye, seing the great crueltie and rigor raigning in her breste, vnto
whom hee dayle prayed for better successe and fortune than to himselfe.
There was no feast, banquet, triumph, or mariage, but Galgano was there,
to do her humble seruice, and that daye his minde was not pleased and
contented, wherein he had not seene her that had his louing harte in
full possession. Very many times (like a Prince
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page4" id = "page4">4</a></span>
that coueted peace) he sente Ambassadours vnto her, wyth presentes and
messages, but she (a&nbsp;proude and scornefull Princesse) dayned
neither to heare them or receiue them. And in this state stode this
passionate Louer a longe time, tormented with the exceeding hote Loue
and fealtie that he bare her. And many times making his reuerent
complaints to loue, did say: “Ah Loue, my deare and soueraigne Lorde,
how cruell and hard harted art thou, how vnmercifully dealest thou with
me, rather how deaf be thine eares, that canst not recline the same to
my nightly complaintes, and dailye afflictions; How chaunceth it that I
do in this maner consume my ioyfull dayes with pining plaintes? Why
doest thou suffer me to Loue, and not to be beloued?” And thus
oftentimes remembringe the crueltie of loue, and his ladies tyrrany, hee
began to dye in maner like a wight replete with despaire. But in fine,
he determined paciently to abide the good time and pleasure of Loue,
still hoping to finde mercie: and daily gaue himselfe to practise and
frequent those thinges that might be acceptable and pleasant to his
Lady, but shee still persisted inexorable. It chaunced that sir Stricca
and his fayre wyfe, for their solace and recreation, repaired to one of
their houses hard by Siena: and upon a time, Galgano passing by with a
Sparhauke on his fiste, made as though he went on Hauking, but of
purpose onely to see his lady. And as he was going by the house, sir
Stricca espied him, and went forth to meete him, and familiarly taking
him by the hand, prayed him to take parte of his supper with his wyfe
and him: for which curtesie Galgano gaue him thanckes, and said: “Sir,
I&nbsp;do thancke you for your curteous requeste, but for this time I
pray you to hold me excused, because I am going about certaine affayres
very requisite and necessary to be done.” Then sayde sir Stricca: “At
least wise drincke with mee before you depart.” But giuing him thankes
he bad him farewell. Maister Stricca seing that hee could not cause him
to tary, toke his leaue, and retourned into his house. Galgano gone from
maistre Stricca, sayd to himselfe: “Ah, beast that I am, why did I not
accept his offer? Why should shamefastness let me from the sight of her,
whom I loue better than all the world besides.” And as he was thus
pensife in complaintes his spaniells sprong a Partrich, wherat he let
flee his
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page5" id = "page5">5</a></span>
Hauke, and the Partrich flying into sir Stricca his garden, his Hauke
pursued and seassed vppon the same. Maister Stricca and his Ladye
hearinge that pastime, ranne to the garden window, to see the killing of
the Partrich: and beholding the valiante skirmishe betweene the foule
and the hauke, the lady asked whose hauke it was: her husband made
aunswere that he knew well inoughe the owner, by the goodnesse and
hardines of the same. “For the owner of this hauke (quoth hee) is the
trimmest and most valiaunt gentleman in all Siena, and one indued with
beste qualities.” The lady demaunded what he was? “Maister Galgano (said
her husband,) who euen now passed by the gate, and I prayed him very
earnestly to supper, but hee woulde not be intreated. And truly wyfe, he
is the comliest gentleman, and moste vertuous personage, that euer I
knewe in my life.” With those wordes they wente from the windowe to
supper: and Galgano, when he had lured his Hauke, departed awaye. The
Lady marked those words and fixed them in minde. It fortuned within a
while after, that sir Stricca was by the state of Siena sent in
ambassage to Perugia, by reason wherof, his Lady at home alone, so sone
as her husband had taken his iourney, sent her most secrete and trustie
maide, to intreat maister Galgano, to come and speake with her. When the
message was done to Galgano, (if&nbsp;his heart were on a merie pinne,
or whether his spirits dulled with continuall sorrowe were againe
reuiued, they knowe that most haue felte the painefull pangues of Loue,
and they also whose flesh haue beene pearced wyth the amorous arrowes of
the little boy Cupide:) he made aunswere that hee would willingly come,
rendringe thanckes both to the maistresse and maide, the one for her
paine, and the other for her good remembraunce. Galgano vnderstanding
that sir Stricca was gone to Perugia, in the eueninge at conuenient
time, repaired to the house of her whose sight he loued better than his
owne eyes. And being come before his Lady, with great submission and
reuerence hee saluted her, (like those whose hartes do throbe, as
foretellinge the possession of good tournes and benefites, after which
with longe sute and trauaile they haue aspired) wherewith the Lady
delighted, very pleasantly took him by the hande, and imbracing him,
said: “Welcome mine owne sweet Galgano, a&nbsp;hundred times I say
welcome.”
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page6" id = "page6">6</a></span>
And for the time with kisses, makinge truce with their affections, the
lady called for comfictes and wyne. And when they had dronke and
refreshed themselues, the lady toke him by the hande and said: “My
sweete Galgano, night beginneth to passe awaye, and the time of sleepe
is come, therefore let vs yeld our selues to the seruice and
commaundment of our very good Ladye, madame Cytherea, for whose sake I
intreated you to come hither.” Galgano aunswered, that he was very wel
contented. Being within the chamber, after much pleasaunte talke and
louing discourse betweene them, the Lady did put of her clothes, and
went to bed. Galgano being somewhat bashfull, was perceyued of the Lady,
vnto whom she said: “Me thincke, Galgano, that you be fearful and
shamefast. What do you lacke? Do I not please you? Doth not my personage
content you? Haue you not the thing which you desire?” “Yes madame,”
said Galgano: “God himself could not do me a greater pleasure, than to
suffer me to be cleped within your armes.” And reasoning in this sort,
he put of his clothes also, and laide himselfe by her, whom he had
coueted and desired of long time. Being in the bed, he said: “Madame,
I&nbsp;beseech you graunt me one resquest.” “What is that, Galgano?”
(quoth she.) “It is this, madame,” said Galgano: “I&nbsp;do much
maruell, why this night aboue all other, you haue sent for mee:
considering how long I haue bin a suter vnto you, and although I haue
prosecuted my sute, by great expence and trauaile, yet you would never
yelde before now: what hath moued you now thus to do?” The Lady
answered: “I&nbsp;wil tell you sir: true it is, that not many dayes
agoe, passing by this house, with your Hauke on your fiste, my husband
told me that so sone as he sawe you, he wente oute to meete you, of
purpose to intreate you to supper, but you would not tarrie: then your
Hauke pursued a Partrich, euen into my garden, and I seing the Hauke so
egerly seasing vpon the same, demaunded of my husband whose Hauke it
was. He told me that the Hauke did belong to the most excellent yong man
of all Siena: and that he neuer in all his life knewe a gentleman better
accomplished with all vertues and good qualities, and therewithal gaue
vnto you singuler prayse and commendacion. Whereuppon hearing him in
such wise to prayse you, and knowing
<span class = "pagenum">

righte well your affectionate minde and disposition towards mee, my hart
attached with loue, forced me to sende for you that I mighte hereafter
auoyde disdaine and other scornefull demeaner, to impeache or hinder
your loue: and this briefely is the cause.” “Is this true?” said
Galgano. “Most certaine and true,” aunsweared the Lady<ins class =
"correction" title = "superfluous close quote in original">.” </ins>“Was
there no other occasion?” “No, verely:” said the lady. “God defend,”
(quoth Galgano,) “that I should recompence the curtesie and good will of
so noble a gentleman (as&nbsp;your husband&nbsp;is) with reproch and
villany. Is it meete that good turnes should be requited with vnkindnes?
If euer man had cause to defende the honor of his vnknowen frend, cause
haue I right good and apte. For now knowinge such a frende, that would
by vertuous reportes haue aduaunced me to higher matters, than wherof I
am in possession, should I reward with pollucion of his stocke and wife?
No, no, lady! my raginge sute by loue, is by vertue quenched. Vertue
onely hath staunched the flames of vile affections. Seeke another
frende, to glut your lecherous minde. Finde out some other companion, to
coole thy disordinate loue. Shal I be disloyal to him, that hath been
faithfull vnto me? Shall I be traytor to him, that frendly hath
commended me? What can be more required of humane hearte, or more
desired of manlike mind, but wilfull bente, and fixed to do him good,
that neuer erst by iuste desert deserued the same.” With which wordes
sodenly hee lept out of the bed, and when he had furnished himselfe
againe with his apparell, hee also put vppon him vertuous friendship,
and takinge his leaue of the Lady, neuer after that time he gaue himself
to matters of Loue. And maister Stricca he continually obserued both
with singuler loue and dutifull friendship: whereby it is vncertaine
whether was most singuler in him, his continency at the very instante by
refrayning that vehement heate of loue, which so long time with great
trauaile and coste he had pursued, or his regard of frendship to sir
Stricca vppon wordes of commendacion spoken behinde his backe. Both no
doubte be singuler vertues meete for all men to be obserued: but the
subduing of his affections surmounted and passed.</p>

THE FORTY-EIGHTH NOUELL.</a></h3>

<p class = "summary">
Bindo a notable Architect, and his sonne Ricciardo, with all his
familie, from Florence went to dwell at Venice where being made Citizens
for diuers monuments by them done there, throughe inordinate expences
were forced to robbe the treasure house. Bindo beinge slaine by a
pollicie deuised by the Duke and state, Ricciardo by fine subtelties
deliuereth himselfe from foure daungers. Afterwards the Duke
(by&nbsp;his owne confession) vnderstandinge the sleightes, giueth him
his pardon and his doughter in marriage.</p>


<p><span class = "firstword">In</span> the goodly citie of Venice there
was once a duke, that was a noble gentleman and of greate experience and
wisedome, called Valeriano di messer Vannozzo Accettani. In the chiefest
Churche of which Citie called San Marco, there was a steple, very faire
and sumptuous, and of greatest fame of any thinge at that time that was
in Venice, which steeple was like to fall downe by reason of certaine
faultes and decayes in the foundacion. Wherfore the Duke caused to be
searched thorow out all Italie, some cunning workeman that would take in
hand the reparacion and amendmente of the same: with promise of so much
money as he would demaund for doing thereof. Whereuppon an excellent
Architect of Florence, named Bindo, hearing tel of this offer,
determined to go to Venice for the accomplishmente of that worke, and
for that purpose with his onelye sonne and wyfe, hee departed Florence.
And when he had seene and surueyed the steeple, he went straight to the
Duke, and told him that he was come thither to offer his seruice for
repayringe of the same, whom the Duke curteously intertayned and prayed
him, that he would so sone as he coulde begin that worke. Whereunto
Bindo accorded, and wyth great diligence and small time he finished the
same, in better forme and surety than it was at the first: which greatly
pleased the Duke, and gaue Bindo so much money as he demaunded, making
him besides a Citizen of Venice, for the maintenaunce of whose state,
hee allotted him a sufficient stipend:
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page9" id = "page9">9</a></span>
afterwards the Duke called him vnto him, and declared that he would haue
a Treasure house made, wherein should be disposed and layde vp all the
Treasure and common ornamentes for the furniture of the whole Citie,
which Bindo by and by toke vppon him to do, and made it of such singuler
beautie, as it excelled all the monuments of the Citie, wherein all the
said Treasure was bestowed. In which worke hee had framed a stone by
cunninge, that mighte be remoued at pleasure, and no man perceiue it:
meaning thereby to goe into the Chamber when he liste: whereunto none in
all the world was priuie but himselfe. When this Palace and Treasure
house was done, he caused all the furnitures of Silkes, hanginges,
wrought with Golde, Canapees, clothes of state, riche Chayres, Plate,
and other Ornaments of Golde and Siluer to be caried thither, whiche he
called La Turpea del Doge, and was kept vnder fiue keyes: whereof foure
were deliuered to foure of the chiefe Citizens, deputed to that office,
which were called Chamberlaynes of the Treasure house, and the fift keye
the Duke himselfe did keepe, so that the Chamber coulde not bee opened
excepte they were all fiue presente. Nowe Bindo and his famelie dwelling
at Venice, and beinge a citizen there, beganne to spende liberallye and
to liue a riche and wealthye life, and hys sonne Ricciardo consumed
disordinatelye, whereby in space of time, they wanted Garmentes to
furnishe their bodies, whiche they were not able to maintaine for their
inordinate expences: wherefore the father vpon a night calling his sonne
vnto him, got a ladder, and a certaine yron instrumente made for the
purpose, and taking also with him a litle lime, went to the hole, which
Bindo artificially had made, who taking out the stone, crept in, and
toke out a faire cup of gold, which was in a closet, and afterward he
wente out, cowching the stone againe in due place. And when they were
come home, they brake the cup and caused it to be solde by peece meale,
in certaine Cities of Lombardie. And in this sorte, they maintayned
their disordinate life begonne. It chaunced not long after, that a
Cardinall arriued at Venice, about affayres with the Duke, and the
state, who the more honorablie to receiue him, opened the Treasure house
to take oute certaine furnitures within, as plate, clothes
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page10" id = "page10">10</a></span>
of state, and other thinges. When the dore was opened, and had taken out
the saide necessaries, they founde a cuppe lesse than oughte to be,
wherewith the Chamberlaines contended amonge themselues, and wente to
the Duke, telling him that there wanted a cuppe: whereat the Duke
marueiled, and said that amonges them it must needes be gone. And after
many denialls, and much talke, he willed them to saye nothing, till the
Cardinall was departed. When the Cardinall was come, he was receyued
with honorable interteignemente, and beinge departed, the Duke sente for
the foure Chamberlaines, to consult about the losse of the cup,
commaunding them not to departe the Palace before the same was found,
saying that amongs them it muste needes be stolen. These four persons
being together, and debating how and by what meanes the cup should be
taken away, were at their wittes ende. At length one of them saide: “Let
vs consider whether ther bee anye comminge into the Chamber besides the
doore.” And viewinge it they coulde not perceiue anye entrie at all. And
to proue the same more effectuallye, they strawed the chamber aboute
with fyne fifted chaffe, setting the same on fier, which done, they
shutte fast the windowes and doores, that the smoke and smoulder might
not goe out. The force of which smoke was sutche as it issued through
the hole that Bindo made, whereby they perceiued the way howe the
robbery was committed, and went to the Duke to tell him what they had
done. The duke vnderstanding the fact, wylled them to saye nothing, for
that he woulde deuise a pollicie how to take the theefe: who caused to
be brought into the chamber a caldron of pitche, and placed it directly
vnder the hole, commaunding that a fyre should be kept daye and night
vnder the caldron, that the same might continually boyle. It come to
passe that when the money was spent which the father and sonne had
receiued for the cup, one night they went agayne to the hole, and
remouing the stone, the father went in as he did before, and fell into
the caldron of pitche (which continually was boyling there) vp to the
waste, and not able to liue any longer, he called his sonne vnto him,
and fayde: “Ricciardo myne owne sweete sonne, death hath taken me
prysoner, for halfe my body is dead, and my breath also is
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page11" id = "page11">11</a></span>
ready to departe. Take my head with thee, and burie it in some place
that it be not knowen, which done, commend me to thy mother, whome I
pray thee to cherishe and comforte, and in any wyse take hede that
warely and circumspectlye thou doe departe from hence: and if any man do
aske for me, say that I am gone to Florence about certaine businesse.”
The sonne lamentably began to lament his father’s fortune, saying: “Oh
deare father, what wicked furie hath thus cruelly deuised sodaine
death.” “Content thy selfe, my sonne,” sayd the father, “and be quiet,
better it is that one should dye, than twoo, therefore doe what I haue
tolde thee, and fare well.” The sonne tooke vp his father’s head, and
went his waye, the reste of his bodye remayned in the caldron, like a
block without forme. When Ricciardo was come home, he buried his
father’s head so well as he could, and afterwardes tolde his mother what
was become of his father, who vnderstanding the maner of his death,
began piteously to cry out, to whom her sonne holding up his hands,
sayd: “Good mother holde your peace, and geue ouer your weeping: for our
life is in great perill and daunger, if your outcrie be heard. Therefore
good mother, quiet yourselfe, for better it were for vs to liue in poore
estate, than to die with infamie, to the vtter reproche and shame of all
our familie.” With whiche woordes he appeased her. In the morning the
bodye was founde and caried to the Duke, who maruelled at it, and could
not deuise what he should be, but sayd: “Surely there be two that
committed this robberie, one of them we haue, let vs imagine how we may
take the other.” Then one of the foure Chamberlaines sayd: “I&nbsp;haue
found out a trap to catche the other, if it will please you to heare
mine aduise, which is this: Impossible it is, but this theefe that is
dead, hath either wife, children, or some kinsman in the citie, and
therfore let vs cause the bodie to be drawen throughout the streates,
and geue diligent hede whether anye persone doe complaine or lament his
death: and if any such be found, let him be taken and examined: which is
the next way as I suppose, to finde out his companion.” Which being
concluded, they departed. The body was drawen throughout the citie with
a guard of men attending vpon the same: as the executioners
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page12" id = "page12">12</a></span>
passed by the house of Bindo, whose carcasse laye vppon the hurdle, his
wyfe stode at the wyndowe, and seing the body of her husband so vsed,
made a great outcrie. At whiche noyse the sonne spake to his mother and
sayde: “Alas, mother, what do you?” And beholding his father’s corps
vpon the hurdle, he toke a knife and made a great gashe into his hande,
that the bloud aboundantly issued out. The guarde hearing the noyse that
the woman made, ran into the house, and asked her what she lacked. The
sonne answered: “I&nbsp;was caruing a peece of stone with this knife,
and by chaunce I hurt my hande, which my mother seeyng cryed out,
thynking that I had hurt myselfe more than I haue.” The guarde seeing
his hande all bloudy and cut, did belieue it to be true, and from thence
went round about the liberties of the Citie, finding none that seemed to
lament or bewayle that chaunce. And returning to the Duke, they tolde
him howe all that labour was imployed in vayne, whereupon he appointed
them to hang vp the dead body in the market-place, with secret watche in
like maner, to espie if any person by day or night, would come to
complaine or be sorrowefull for him. Which body was by the feete hanged
vp there, and a continuall watche appointed to kepe the same. The rumor
hereof was bruted throughout the Citie, and euery man resorted thither
to see it. The woman hearing tell that her husbandes carcasse should be
hanged vp in the market-place, saide diuerse times to her sonne, that it
was a very great shame for him to suffer his father’s body in that
shamefull sort to be vsed. To whom her sonne made answere, saying: “Good
mother, for God’s sake be contented, for that whiche they do is for none
other purpose, but to proue me: wherefore be pacient a while, till this
chaunce be past.” The mother not able to abide it any longer, brake out
many times into these words: “If I were a man as I am a woman, it should
not be vndone now: and if thou wilt not aduenture thy selfe, I&nbsp;will
one night giue the attempt.” The yong man seing the froward nature of
his mother, determined to take away the body by this policie. He
borrowed twelve friers frockes or cowles, and in the euening went downe
to the hauen, and hired twelue mariners, and placed them in a backe
house, geuing them so much meate and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page13" id = "page13">13</a></span>
drinke as they woulde eate. And when they had well whitled and tippled
themselues, he put vpon them those friers cowles, with visards vppon
their faces, and gaue euery of them in their hands a burning torch,
making them to seme as though they had ben Diuels of hel: and he himself
rode vpon a horse al couered with blacke, beset rounde about with
monstrous and vglie faces, euerye of them hauinge a burnyng candle in
his mouthe, and riding before with a visarde of horrible shape vpon his
head, sayde vnto them: “Doe as I doe:” and then marched forward to the
market-place. When they came thether they ran vp and downe with roring
voyces crying out like Deuils being then past midnight and very darke.
When the watche sawe that straunge sight they were affrayde, thinking
that they had bene Deuils indeede, and that he on horsebacke in that
forme had ben the great Deuill Lucifer himselfe. And seing him runne
towardes the gibet, the watche toke their legges and ran away. The yong
man in the shape of the great Deuill toke downe the body and layd it
before him on horsebacke, who calling his companie away, roode before in
poste. When they were come home, he gaue them their money, and vncasing
them of their cowles sent them away, and afterwardes buried the body so
secretly as he could. In the morning newes came to the Duke that the
bodye was taken awaye, who sent for the guarde to knowe what was become
thereof. To whome they sayde these wordes: “Pleaseth your grace, about
midnight last past there came into the market-place a companie of
Deuils, among whom we sawe the great deuil Lucifer himselfe, who as wee
suppose did eate vp the bodye, which terrible sight and vision made vs
to take our legges.” The Duke by those wordes perceiued euidently that
the same was but a practise to deceiue them of their purpose,
notwithstanding he determined once again to deuise some meanes in the
ende to knowe the truthe, and decreed a constitucion that for the space
of xx dayes no fresh meate shoulde be solde in Venice: at which decree
all the citie marueiled. Afterwardes he caused a verie faire fatte calfe
to be solde, sessing the price of euery pounde at a fiorino, which
amounteth to a French crowne or thereaboutes, and willed hym that solde
it to note and marke them that bought it: thinking with himselfe, that
he which is a theefe is licorous of mouth delicate
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page14" id = "page14">14</a></span>
in fare and would not stick to geue a good price, although it cost him a
French crown for euery pound: making proclamation, that he which would
buye any fresh meate should resort to the market-place where was to bee
solde. All the Marchaunts and Gentlemen repaired to buye some of the
veale, and vnderstanding that euery pound would not be solde under a
Frenche crowne, they bought none at all. This calfe and the price was
bruted in all places, and came to the knowledge of the mother of this
yong man, who said vnto her sonne: “I&nbsp;haue a minde to eate some of
the veale, now solde in the market.” Ricciardo aunswered. “Mother make
no haste to buye it, first let it be cheapened by other, and at length I
will deuise a meane that you shall have it: for it is not wysedome for
vs to be the firste that shall desire it.” The mother like an ignoraunt
and vnskilfull woman, was importunate to haue it. The sonne fearing that
his mother would sende for some of the veale, by other, caused a Pie to
be made, and prepared a flagon full of wyne, both which were intermixed
with thinges to cause sleepe, and taking bread, the sayd Pie, and the
flagon of wyne, when it was night, putting on a counterfait beard, and
cloke, went to the stall where that veale was to bee solde, which as yet
was whole and vnbought. And when he had knocked at the shop dore, one of
the guard asked who was there. To whom Ricciardo said: “Can you tel me
wher one Ventura doth kepe his shop?” Of whom one of them demaunded what
Ventura? “I&nbsp;know not his surname,” sayde Ricciardo, “that I would
he had bene hanged, when I came first to dwell with him.” “Why who sent
thee?” said one of the guarde. “His wyfe (quod Ricciardo) who bade me
cary him this meate and wyne for his supper: but I pray you (sayde
Ricciardo,) let me leaue the same with you, till I goe home to know
better where he kepeth his stall. And maruell not, my maisters, though I
know not where his shop is, for it is not long sithens I came to dwell
in this Citie.” And so leauing behind him the Pie, and the bread with
the flagon of wyne, he made haste to departe, and tolde them that he
wold come againe by and by. When he was gone, one of them toke the
flagon and drancke, and afterwardes gaue it to his companion, and said:
“Drinke, for thou neuer diddest tast of better wyne in all thy life.”
His companion dranke, and merily communing of
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page15" id = "page15">15</a></span>
this matter, they fel a sleepe. Ricciardo loking in at a hole of the
dore, seing them a slepe, went in, and toke the calfe, and caried it
home whole as it was, and saide to his mother: “Hold, mother, there is
your luste, cut it out:” and by and by she cut out a great pece. The
duke so sone as he heard that the calfe was stolen, and the maner howe,
did wonder very muche, purposing yet to knowe what hee was: and caused a
hundred poore people to come before him, whose names being written, he
said vnto them: <ins class = "addition" title =
"open quote missing">“</ins>Get
ye to all the houses in Venice, vnder colour to
begge almes. And marke if you see in any house fleshe dressed, or any
pece in making ready to be eaten at the fier, which if you doe, ye must
be importunate in begging, till they giue you either flesh or broth. And
he among all you that shal bring me the first newes, I&nbsp;wil giue him
xx crownes.” These beggers dispersed themselues into euery corner of the
Citie, crauing their almes, amongs whom one of them asked his almes at
the house of Ricciardo, and approching nere, espied openly fleshe at the
spit, and besought a morsell thereof for God’s sake: to whom the
vndiscrete woman seeing that she had plentye, gaue a litle pece. The
poore man thanked the good wife, and prayed God to saue her life. And as
hee was going down the steps of the dore, Ricciardo met him with the
flesh in his hand. Wherewithal astonned, he willed him to retourne, and
sayde he would giue him more. The begger glad of that, went in againe,
whome Ricciardo caried into his chamber, and when he was within, he
strake suche a full blowe vpon his head with an axe, as he killed hym,
and threwe him into a iakes, shutting the doore after him. In the
euening, these poore men retourned to the duke, according to their
promise, and sayde they coulde finde nothing. The Duke called them by
their names, and compting the number founde one lesse than he had sent,
whereat he maruelled. And after he had well aduised with himselfe, what
should become of him that lacked, he sayde: “Certainely the poore man is
Slayne.” Then causing the councell to be assembled, he declared what he
had done: and yet sayde that it were meete the party were knowen.
Whereunto one of the Senatours sayde: <ins class = "addition" title =

belly and mouth, to finde out this verlet: I&nbsp;thinke it nowe
necessarie
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page16" id = "page16">16</a></span>
that triall be made by lechery, whiche commonly accompanieth licorous
mouthes.” Then it was concluded that the moste riotous and lecherous
yong men, suche as the Duke had in greatest suspicion, to the number of
<span class = "smallroman">XXV.</span> should be warned to appeare
before him: whiche accordingly was done, amonges whome was this
Ricciardo. These yonge roisters assembled in the palace, euery of them
maruelled wherefore the Duke had caused them to come thether. Afterwarde
the Duke commaunded <span class = "smallroman">XXV.</span> beddes to be
made in one of his great chambers, to lodge euery of the sayd <span
class = "smallroman">XXV.</span> persons by hymself, and in the middes
of the chamber he commaunded a riche bed of estate to be set vp and
furnished, wher was appointed to ly his own daughter, which was an
exceading faire creature. And in the night when these yong men were
layde in their beddes, manye gentlewomen attendant vpon the Lady, came
in to bryng her to her lodging: and her father deliuered to her a sawcer
full of black die, or stayning, and saide vnto her: “If any of these
yong men that doe lie here by thee, doe offer to come to thy bedde,
looke that thou marke him in the face with this staining colour, that he
may be knowen.” At which wordes all the yong men maruelled and therefore
durste not attempt to goe vnto her, but said one to another: “Surely
this commaundement of the Duke hath some secrete misterie in it.”
Notwithstanding Ricciardo determined about midnight to go to her bedde:
and when the candle was out being a wake of purpose, he rose vp and went
to the gentlewoman’s bedde and began to imbrace and kisse her. The
maiden when she felt him, sodainly dipped her finger in the colour and
stained his face, not perceiued of him. When he had accomplished the
thing he came for, hee retourned to his place: and then began to imagin
vpon the Duke’s wordes, and for what policie he spake them. And lying a
litle while still musing vpon the same, he went againe to the
gentlewoman’s bedde, hauing throughly disposed himself to the pleasures
of this paradise lambe: and perceiuing her to dippe her finger in the
sawcer and rubbe his face, Ricciardo toke away the sawcer from the
bedde’s side, and round about bestowed the colour vpon the faces of his
felowes, who were so faste a sleepe that they did not fele him. Some he
marked
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page17" id = "page17">17</a></span>
with two spottes, some with six and some with <span class =
"smallroman">X.</span> himselfe he painted but with foure besides those
wherewith already he was berayed by the gentlewoman: whiche done he set
the saucer agayne by the bedde’s side, and when he had bidden her
farewell, faire and softly he returned againe to his bedde. In the
morning betimes, the damosels of the chamber came in to helpe the ladye
to make her readye, which done they wayted vpon her to the duke, who
asked her how the matter stode. She aunswered well, for she had done his
commaundement: and tolde him howe one came vnto her three times, and
euery time she gaue him a tainte in his face. The duke by and by sent
for them that were of his counsell. To whome he said: “Sirs, I&nbsp;haue
founde out this good fellow, and therfore I haue sent for you, that we
altogether may goe to see him.” They went all into the chamber, and
viewing them round about, they perceiued all their faces coloured,
whereat they fell into a great laughter: then one of them sayde to
another: “Suerly this fellowe hath the subtilest head that euer was
knowen:” and concluded that one of the company had set that colour in
their faces. The yong men beholding one another paynted in that sorte,
brake into great sporte and pastime. Afterwardes the duke examined euery
of them, and seeing that he was not able by any meanes to vnderstande by
whome it was done, he determined to knowe the man before he departed,
and promised to him that should confesse the truthe, to giue his
daughter to him in mariage, and with her a very great dowrie, and a
generall pardon. Wherefore Ricciardo vnderstanding the duke’s minde,
toke him asyde, and tolde hym the whole matter particularly from the
beginning to the ende. The duke imbraced hym, and gaue him his pardon,
and with great ioye and triumphe he solemnized the mariage betwene hym
and his daughter. Wherewithal Ricciardo encouraged, proued a very stoute
and valiaunt man in suche wyse almoste as the affaires of the whole
state passed through his handes. And liued a long time after, with the
loue and good wyll of the whole cominaltie of Venice.</p>

THE FORTY-NINTH NOUELL.</a></h3>

<p class = "summary">
Philenio Sisterno, a&nbsp;Scholler of Bologna, being mocked of three
faire Gentlewomen, at a banket made of set purpose he was reuenged on
them all.</p>


<p><span class = "firstword">At</span> Bologna, whiche is the noblest
citie of Lombardie, the mother of studies, and accomplished with al
things nedefull and requisite for sutch a florishing state, there was a
yong scholler, a&nbsp;Gentleman of the countrie of Crete named Philenio
Sisterno, of very good grace and behauiour. It chanced that in his time,
there was a great feast made in the citie, wherunto were bidden the
fayrest dames, and beste of reputation there: there was likewyse many
Gentlemen and Schollers of Bologna, amonges whom was this Philenio
Sisterno: who followyng the manner of young men, dallying sometime with
one, sometime with another, and perceiuing them for his purpose
determined to daunce with one of them: and comming to one whiche was
called Emerentiana, the wyfe of sir Lamberto Bentiuoglia, hee prayed her
to daunce: who, beyng verie gentle and of no less audacitie than
beautiful, refused not. Then Philenio leading forth the daunce very
softly, sometymes wrynging her by the hand, spake somewhat secretly vnto
her these wordes: “Madame, your beautie is so great, that without doubt
it surmounteth all that ever I sawe, and there is no woman in the world
to whome I beare so great affection, as to your persone, whiche if it
were correspondent to me in Loue, I&nbsp;would thinke myself the beste
contented man in the world, otherwyse I shall in shorte tyme bee
depriued of life, and then you shall be the cause of my death: and
louing you (Madame) as I doe, and as my dutie requireth, you ought to
take me for your seruaunt, vsing me and those litle goodes whiche I haue
as your owne: and I doe assure you, that it is impossible for me to
receiue greater fauour from heauen, then to see myselfe subiecte to
sutch a gentlewoman, as you be, whiche hath taken me in a nette lyke a
byrde.” Nowe Emerentiana, whiche earnestly had marked those sweet and
pleasaunt woordes, like a wyse gentlewoman, semed to geue no eare
thereunto, and made him no aunswere at all. The daunce ended, and
Emerentiana being
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page19" id = "page19">19</a></span>
set down in her place, this young scholler went to take another
gentlewoman by the hand, and began to daunce with her: whiche was not so
sone begonne, but thus he said vnto her: “It nedeth not Madame, that by
woordes I doe expresse the feruant Loue which I beare you, and will so
doe, so long as my poore spirite shall gouerne and rule my members: and
if I could obtaine you for my Maistresse and singuler Ladye,
I&nbsp;would thinke myself the happiest man aliue. Then louing you as I
do, and being wholly yours, as you may easely vnderstand, refuse me not
I besech you for your humble seruaunt, sithe that my life and all that I
haue dependeth vpon you alone.” The yong gentlewoman, whose name was
Panthemia, perceiuing his meaning, did not aunswere him any thing at
that time: but honestly proceded in her daunce: and the daunce ended,
smyling a litle, she sat downe with the other dames. This done, amorous
Philenio rested not vntil he had taken the thirde by the hand, (who was
the gentlest, fairest, and trimmest dame in all Bologna,) and began to
daunce with her, romyng abrode, to shewe his cunning before them that
came to behold him. And before the daunce was finished, he saide thus
vnto her: “Madame, it may so be, as I shall seme vnto you very malapert
to manifest the secret Loue that I haue and doe beare you at this
instant, for which you ought not to blame me but your beautie, which
rendreth you excellent aboue al the rest, and maketh me your slaue and
prysoner. I&nbsp;speake not of your commendable behauiour, of your
excellent and maruellous vertues, which be such and of so great effect,
as they would make the gods descend to contemplate the same. If then
your excellent beautie and shape, so well fauoured by nature, and not by
art, may seeme to content the immortall Gods, you ought not to be
offended, if the same do constraine me to loue you, and to inclose you
in the priuie cabane of my harte: I&nbsp;beseeche you then, gentle
Madame (the onely comfort of my life) to haue pitie vpon him that dieth
a thousand times a daye for you. In so doing, my life shall be prolonged
by you, commending me humbly vnto your good grace.” This faire
gentlewoman called Simphorosia, vnderstanding the sweete and pleasaunt
woordes vttered from the very harte of Philenio, could not dissemble her
sighes, but waying her honor, because she was maried,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page20" id = "page20">20</a></span>
gaue him no answere at all. And the daunce ended, she retourned to her
place. Nowe it chaunced, as these three ladies did sit together iocundly
disposed to debate of sundrie mery talke, behold Emerentiana, the wife
of Seignior Lamberto, not for any euill, but in sporting wise said vnto
her companions: “Gentlewomen, I&nbsp;haue to tell you a pleasaunt matter
which happened to this day.” “What is that?” said her companions.
“I&nbsp;haue gotten this night, (said she) in dauncing, a&nbsp;curteous
louer, a&nbsp;very faire Gentleman, and of so good behauiour as any in
the worlde: who said that he was so inflamed with my beauty that he
tooke no rest day nor night:” and from point to point, rehearsed vnto
them, all that he had said. Which Panthemia and Simphorosia
vnderstanding, answered that the like had chaunced vnto them, and they
departed not from the feaste before eche of theim knewe him that was
their louer: whereby they perceiued that his woordes proceded not of
faithfull Loue, but rather of follie and dissimulation, in suche wise as
they gaue so lyghte credite thereunto, as of custome is geuen to the
woordes of those that bee sicke. And they departed not from thence
vntill all three with one accorde, had conspired euery one to giue him
mocke. Philenio continuing thus in Loue, sometime with one, sometime
with another, and perceiuing that euery of them seemed to Loue him, hee
determined with himselfe, if it were possible to gather of them the last
frute of his Loue. But he was greatly deceyued in his desire, for that
all his enterprise was broken: and that done, Emerentiana whiche could
not any longer dissemble the loue of the foolishe scholer called one of
her maydes, which was of a fayre complexion and a ioly wenche, charging
her that she should deuise meanes to speake with Philenio, to geue him
to vnderstande the loue which her maistresse bare vnto him: and when it
were his pleasure she willingly would one night haue him at home at her
house. Which newes when Philenio heard, he greatly reioyced, and said to
the maid: “Returne to your Maistresse, faire maide, and commend me vnto
her, telling her in my behalf, that I doe praye her to loke for me this
euening, if her husband be not at home.” During which time, Emerentiana
caused a certaine number of fagots of sharpe thornes to be made, and to
be layd vnder her bedde
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page21" id = "page21">21</a></span>
still wayting for her minion. When night was come, Philenio toke his
sworde, and went to the house of his enemy, and calling at the dore with
the watchworde the same incontinently was opened: and after that they
had talked a litle while together, and banketted after the best maner,
they withdrew themselues into the chamber to take their reste. Philenio
had no soner put of his clothes to goe to bedde, but Seignior Lamberto
her husband came home: which the Maistresse of the house perceiuing,
made as though she had bene at her wittes ende, and could not tell
whether to conuey her minion, but prayed him to hide himself vnder the
bedde. Philenio seeing the daunger, wherein both he and the wife were,
not taking with him any other garmentes, but only his shirte, crept
vnder the bed where he was so cruelly prickt and scratched with the
thornes, as there was no parte of his body (from the toppe of his head
to the sole of his foote) free from bloud, and the more he sought to
defende himselfe in that darke place, the more sharpely and piteously he
was tormented, and durst not crie for feare least Seignior Lamberto
would kill him. I&nbsp;will leaue to your consideration in what plight
this poore wretche was in, who by reason of his miserable being, as he
was brechelesse in that terrible purgatorie, even so was he speachlesse
and durst not speake for his life. In the morning when Segnior Lamberto
was gone forth, the poore scholler put on his clothes so well as he
could, and all bloudy as he was, returning to his lodging, was like to
die: but being deligently cured by phisicians, in short time he
recouered his former health. Shortly after, Philenio began to pursue
again his loue towardes the other two, that is to say, Panthemia and
Simphorosia, and found conuenient time one euening to speake to
Panthemia, to whom he rehearsed his griefes and continuall tormentes,
praying her to haue pitie vpon him. The subtile and wise wenche
Panthemia, fayning to haue compassion vppon him, excused her selfe by
lacke of meanes to content his desire, but in thend vanquished with
faire supplications and maruellous sighes, shee made him to come home to
her house, and being vnready, dispoyled of al his apparell to go to bed
with his Lady she required hym to go with her into a litle closet, wher
all her swete smels and perfumes were, to the intent he might be well
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page22" id = "page22">22</a></span>
perfumed before he went to bedde. The yong dolt not doubting the
subtiltie of this wicked woman, entred the closet and setting his foote
vpon a borde <ins class = "correction" title =
"text unchanged">vnnnayled</ins> from the ioyst, fell so depe into a
store house where marchauntes vse to lay there cottons and wolles, as he
thought he had broken his necke and his legges, notwithstanding as
fortune would he had no hurt. This poore scholler being in that darke
place, began to seke for some dore or ladder to go out, and finding
nothing for his purpose he cursed the houre and time that euer he knew
Panthemia. When the dauning of the day began to appeare, the simple sot
discried in one place of the storehouse certain ventes in the wall,
which gaue some light, because they wer old and couered ouer with mosse,
in such wise, as he began with maruelous force, to pluck out the stones
in the moste decaied place of the wall, and made so great a hole, as he
went out. And being in a lane hard by the great streate, barefoote and
bare legged, and in his shirt, he went home to his lodging vnknowen of
any. A&nbsp;litle whyle after Simphorosia vnderstanding of the deceits
whiche the other twoo had done to Philenio, attempted to geue hym the
thirde, whiche was not inferior to the other twayne. And for that
purpose, she began a farre of to caste her amorous lokes vpon him,
letting hym to knowe that shee was in great distresse for his Loue. This
poore soule hauing already forgotten his fortune paste, began to walke
vp and downe before her house, like a man altogether tormented and
pained with Loue. Then Simphorosia, seing him to be farre in loue with
her, sent hym a letter by an old woman, whereby she aduertised hym, that
his beautie and good behauior, so puissantly did gouerne her affections
as she could take no rest night nor day, for the earnest loue that she
bare him: wherefore she praied him if it were his pleasure to come and
speake with her. Philenio receiuing that letter, and perusing the
contentes, not considering the deceite prepared for him, ne yet any
longer remembring the iniuries past, was more ioyfull and glad then euer
he was before: who taking pen and paper, aunswered her againe, that he
for his parte suffered no lesse tormentes for her sake, yea and in
respect of vnfayned Loue, that he loued her farre better than she did
hym, and at al tymes when shee pleased, hee woulde be at her
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page23" id = "page23">23</a></span>
commaundement to doe her seruice: the aunswere read, and oportunitie
found, Simphorosia caused him to come home to her house, and after many
false sighes, she saide vnto him: “My deare frend Philenio, I&nbsp;knowe
none other in all the world, that hath brought me into this state and
plighte wherein presently I am, but you, because your beautie, good
grace and pleasaunt talke, haue so sette my harte on fyre as I feele it
to kindle and burne like drye woode.” Which talke Maister scholler
hearing, thought assuredly that she consumed for loue of him: this poore
Nodgecock, contriuing the time in sweete and pleasaunt woordes, with his
dareling Simphorosia, the time approched that he should go to bed with
his faire lady, who said vnto him: “My swete frend Philenio, abide a
whyle, and let vs make some banket and collation:” who taking him by the
hande, caried him into her closet adioyning, wher was a table ready
furnished with exquisit conficts and wynes of the best. This gentlewoman
had made a composition in the wyne, to cause this yong gallant to sleepe
for a certain time. Philenio thinking no hurte, toke the cup and filled
it with the wyne, and dranke it vp at one draught. His spirits reuiued
with this refreshing, after he had bene very well perfumed and washed in
swete waters, he went to bedde and within a while after this drinke
began to woorke, and hee slepte so soundly, as canon shot, or the
greatest gonnes of the worlde were not able to wake hym: then
Simphorosia perceiuing the drinke beginne to woorke, called one of her
sturdy maides that wel was instructed in the game of this pageant: both
whiche carying this poore sleepy scholler by the feete and armes, and
opening the dore very softlye, they fayre and well bestowed hym in the
middeste of the streete, a&nbsp;good stone’s caste of from the house,
where he lay all the nighte. But when the dawning of the daye dyd
appeare, or an houre before, the drynke lost his vertue, and the poore
soule began to awake, and thinking that he had bene a bedde with the
gentlewoman he perceiued hymself brechelesse and in his shirt more dead
then aliue, through the colde that he had endured, by lying starke naked
vppon the earth. The poore wretche was not able to help himselfe so much
as with his armes and legges, ne yet to stande vppon his feete without
great paine: notwithstanding, through
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page24" id = "page24">24</a></span>
creping and sprawling, hee got home to his house, vnseene of anye, and
prouided so well as hee could for recouery of his health: and had it not
been for his youth, which did helpe him at that instant, his sinewes had
been benommed for euer. In the ende, hauing atteined his former state of
health he still remembred the iniuries past, and without shewing any
signe of anger or displeasure, made as though he loued them all three
better then euer he did before, and sometime seemed to be in loue with
the one, and sometime with an other: they againe for their part nothing
mistrusting the malice of Philenio, set a good face on the matter,
vsinge amorous cheere and countenance towards him, but when his backe
was tourned, with mockes and floutes they toke their pleasure. He
bearing in his brest secrete despite, was still desirous with his hand
to marke them in the face, but like a wise man, waying the natures of
women, he thought it woulde redounde to his greate shame and reproche,
if hee did them any hurt: and therefore restrayning the heate of his
choler vsed pacience. And yet by deuising and practising, how he might
be euen with them and reuenged, hee was in great perplexitie. Very
shortly after it chaunced that the scholler had inuented a meane, easely
to satisfie his desire, and so sone as hee had fully resolued what to
do, fortune therunto was fauorable: who hyred in the citie of Bologna a
very faire house which had a large hall, and comodious chambers: and
purposed to make a greate and sumptuous feast, and to inuite many Ladies
and Gentlewomen to the same: amongs whom these three were the first that
should be bidden: which accordingly was done: and when the feast day was
come the three gentlewomen that were not very wise at that instante,
repaired thither nothing suspecting the scholler’s malice. In the end a
litle to recreate the Gentlewomen and to get them a stomacke, attendinge
for supper time, the Scholler toke these his three louers by the hand,
and led them friendly into a chamber, somewhat to refresh them. When
these three innocent women were come into the Scholler’s Chamber, hee
shut fast the doore, and going towards them, he sayde: “Beholde faire
ladies, now the time is come for me to be reuenged vpon you and to make
you suffer the penaunce of the torment wherwith ye punished me for my
great Loue.”
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page25" id = "page25">25</a></span>
The Gentlewomen hearing those cruell woordes, rather dead then aliue,
began to repent that euer they had offended him, and besides that, they
cursed themselues, for giuinge credit vnto him whom they ought to haue
abhorred. The Scholler with fierce and angry countenaunce commaunded
them vpon paine of their liues to strippe themselues naked: which
sentence when these three goddesses heard, they began to loke one vppon
another, weeping and praying him, that although he woulde not for their
sakes, yet in respect of his owne curtesie and naturrall humanitie, that
hee woulde saue their honor aboue all thinges. This gallant reioysing at
their humble and pitifull requestes was thus curteous vnto them, that he
would not once suffer them to stand with their garmentes on in his
presence: the women casting themselues downe at his feete wept bitterly,
beseeching him that he woulde haue pitie vpon them, and not to be the
occasion of a slaunder so great and infamous. But he whose hart was
hardened as the Diamonde, said vnto them, that this facte was not worthy
of blame but rather of reuenge. The women dispoyled of their apparel
(and standing before him, so free from couering as euer was Eue before
Adam) appeared as beautifull in this their innocent state of nakednes,
as they did in their brauerie: in so much that the yong scholler viewing
from toppe to toe, those fayre and tender creatures, whose whitenesse
surpassed the snow, began to haue pitie vppon them: but calling to his
remembraunce the iniuries past and the daunger of death wherein he was,
he reiected all pitie and continued his harde and obstinate
determination. Then he toke all their apparell, and other furnitures
that they did weare, and bestowed it in a little chamber, and with
threatning words commaunded all three to lie in one bed. The women
altogether astonned, began to say to themselues: “Alas, what fooles be
we? what wil our husbands and our frendes say, when they shal vnderstand
that we be found naked and miserablie slaine in this bed? It had been
better for vs to haue died in our cradels, than apprehended and found
dead in this state and plight.” The Scholler seeing them bestowed one by
another in the bed, like husband and wyfe, couered them with a very
white and large sheete, that no part of their bodies might be seene and
knowen, and shutting the Chamber
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page26" id = "page26">26</a></span>
doore after him Philenio went to seeke their husbands, which were
dauncing in the hall: and the daunce ended, he intreated them to take
the paines to goe with him: who was their guide into the Chamber where
the three Muses lay in their bedde, saying vnto them: “Sirs, I&nbsp;haue
broughte you into this place to shewe you some pastime and to let you
see the fayrest thinges that euer you saw in your liues.<ins class =
"addition" title = "close quote missing">”</ins> Then approching neere
the bed, and holding a torch in his hand, he began fayre and softly to
lift vp the shete at the bed’s feete, discouering these fayre ladies
euen to the knees. Ye should haue seen then, how the hushands did behold
their white legges and their wel proporcioned feete, which don he
disclosed them euen to the stomack, and shewed their legges and thighes
farre whiter than alablaster, which seemed like two pillers of fine
marble, with a rounde body so wel formed as nothing could be better:
consequently he tourned vp the sheete a litle further, and their
stomackes appeared somewhat round and plumme, hauing two rounde breasts
so firme and feate, as they would haue constrayned the great God Iupiter
to imbrace and kisse them. Whereat the husbandes toke so great pleasure
and contentmente, as coulde be deuised: I&nbsp;omitte for you to thincke
in what plighte these poore naked women weare, hearinge theyr husbandes
to mocke them: all this while they laye very quiet, and durst not so
much as to hem or coughe, for feare to be knowen: the husbands were
earnest with the Scholler to discouer their faces, but hee wiser in
other mennes hurtes than in his owne, would by no meanes consent vnto
it. Not contented with this, the yong scholler shewed their apparel to
their husbands, who seing the same were astonned, and in viewing it with
great admiration, they said one to another: “Is not this the gowne that
I once made for my wife? Is not this the coyfe that I bought her? Is not
this the pendant that she weareth about her necke? be not these the
rings that set out and garnisht her fingers?” Being gone out of the
chamber for feare to trouble the feast, he would not suffer them to
depart, but caused them to tarie supper. The Scholler vnderstandinge
that supper was ready, and that the maister of the house had disposed
all thinges in order, he caused the geastes to sit downe. And whiles
they were remouing and placing the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page27" id = "page27">27</a></span>
stooles and chayres, he returned into the chamber, wher the three dames
lay, and vncouering them, he sayd vnto them: “Bongiorno, faire Ladies:
did you heare your hushandes? They be here by, and do earnestly tarie
for you at supper. What do ye meane to do? Vp and rise ye dormouses,
rubbe your eyes and gape no more, dispatche and make you ready, it is
time for you now to repayre into the hall, where the other gentlewomen
do tarie for you.” Behold now how this Scholer was reuenged by
interteigning them after this maner: then the poore desolate women,
fearing least their case would sorte to som pitiful successe, dispayring
of their health, troubled and discomforted, rose vp expecting rather
death than any other thing: and tourning them toward the scholler they
said vnto him: “Maister Philenio, you haue had sufficient reueng vpon
vs: the best for you to do now, is to take your sword, and to bereue us
of oure life, which is more lothsome vnto vs than pleasaunt: and if you
will not do vs that good tourne, suffer vs to go home to our houses
vnknowen, that our honours may be saued.” Then Philenio thinking that he
had at pleasure vsed their persons, deliuered them their apparel, and so
sone as they were ready, he let them out at a litle dore, very secretlye
vnknowen of anye, and so they went home to their houses. So sone as they
had put of their fayre furnitures, they folded them vp, and layd them in
their chestes: which done, they went about their houshold busines, till
their husbands came home, who being retourned they founde their wives
sowing by the fire side in their chambers: and because of their
apparell, their ringes and iewels, which they had seene in the
Scholler’s Chamber, it made them to suspect their wiues, euery of them
demaunding his seuerall wife, where she had bin that nighte, and where
their apparell was. They well assured of themselues, aunswered boldly,
that they were not out of their house all the euening, and taking the
keyes of their cofers shewed them their aparell, their ringes and other
things, which their husbandes had made them. Which when their husbandes
saw, they could not tell what to say, and forthwith reiected all
suspicion, which they had conceiued: telling them from point to point,
what they had seen that night. The women vnderstanding those woordes,
made as though they knew nothing and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page28" id = "page28">28</a></span>
after a little sport and laughter betweene them, they went to bed. Many
times Philenio met his Gentlewomen in the streates and sayde vnto them:
“Which of you was most afraide or worste intreated?” But they holding
downe their heads, passed forth not speaking a word: in this maner the
Scholler was requited so well as he could of the deceites done against
him, by the three Gentlewomen aforesaid.</p>

The piteous and chaste death of one of the muleters wiues of the Queene

<p><span class = "firstword">In</span> the citie of Amboise, there was a
muleter that serued the Queene of Nauarre, sister to king Fraunces the
firste of that name, which was broughte a bedde of a sonne at Blois: to
which towne the said muleter was gone to be paide his quarter’s wages:
whose wyfe dwelled at Amboise beyond the bridges. It chaunced that of
long time one of her husband’s seruauntes did so disordinately loue her,
as vppon a certaine day he could not forbeare but he muste vtter the
effect of his loue borne vnto her. Howbeit shee being a right honest
woman, tooke her man’s sute in very ill part, threatning to make her

farre from her house: who now being alone in the house, began to imagine
how he might attempt that thinge by force, which before by no
supplication or seruice he was able to attaine. For which purpose, hee
brake vp a borde betweene his Maistresse chamber and his: but because
the curteins of his maister and maistresse bed, and of the seruauntes of
the other side couered and hid the walles betweene, it could not be
perceyued, nor yet his malice discried vntill suche time as his
Maistresse was gone to bed, with a litle wenche of <span class =
"smallroman">XII.</span> yeares of age: and so sone as the poore woman
was fallen into her first sleepe, this varlet entred in at a hole which
he had broken, and conueyed himself into her bed in his shirt, with a
naked sworde in his hande: who so sone as she felt him layed downe by
her, lepte out of her bed, perswading him by all possible meanes meete
for an honest woman to do: and he indued with beastly loue, rather
acquainted with the language of his mulets
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page30" id = "page30">30</a></span>
than with her honest reasons, shewed himselfe more beastly then the
beasts with whom he had of long time bin conuersant: for seing her so
oft to runne about the table that he could not catch her, and also that
she was so strong, that twise she ouercame him, in dispaire that he
should neuer enioy her aliue, hee gaue her a great blow with his sword
ouer the raines of the back, thinking that if feare and force could not
make her to yeld, paine and smart should cause her. Howbeit, the
contrarie chaunced: for like as a good man of armes when he seeth his
owne bloud, is more set on fier to be reuenged vpon his enemies to
acquire honor: euen so the chaste hart of this woman, did reenforce and
fortefie her courage in double wise, to auoyde and escape the hands of
this wicked varlet, deuising by all meanes possible by fayre words to
make him acknowledge his fault: but he was so inflamed with furie, there
was no place in him to receiue good counsell. And eftsones with his
sword, he gashed her tender bodye with diuers and sondry strokes, for
the auoydiug wherof, so fast as her legges could beare her, she ran vp
and downe the chamber: and when through want of bloud she perceiued
death approch, lifting vp her eyes vnto heaven, and ioyning her hands
together, gaue thanckes vnto God, whom she termed to be her force, her
vertue, her pacience and chastitie, humblie beseeching him to take in
good part the bloude whiche by his commandemente was sheade in honor of
that precious bloude, which from his owne sonne did issue vppon the
Crosse, whereby shee did beleeue, firmelye and stedfastlye that all her
sinnes were wiped awaye and defaced from the memorye of his wrathe and
anger, and in sayinge: “Lorde receiue my soule which was dearely bought
and redeemed with thy bounty and goodnes:” shee fell downe to the ground
vpon her face where the wycked villaine inflicted her bodye with
manifold wounds: and after she had lost her speache and the force of her
body, thys most wicked and abhominable varlet toke her by force, whiche
had no more strength and power to defende herselfe: and when he had
satisfied his cursed desire, he fled away in such hast, as afterwards
for all the pursute made after him he could not be found. The yong wench
which lay
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page31" id = "page31">31</a></span>
with her, for feare hid herselfe vnder the bed. But when she perceyued
the villaine departed, shee came vnto her Maistresse and finding her
speachlesse and without mouing, she cryed out at the window vnto the
nexte neighbours to come to succour her: and they which loued her and
esteemed her so wel as any woman in the towne, came presently vnto her,
and brought diuers surgeons with them, who findinge vpon her body <span
class = "smallroman">XXV.</span> mortall woundes, they did so much as in
them laye to helpe her: but it was impossible. Howbeit shee laye one
houre without speache, makinge signes with hir eyes and hands, declaring
that she had not lost her vnderstanding: being demaunded by the priest,
of the fayth wherin she died, and of her saluacion, she aunswered by
such euident signes, as her liuely speach and communication coulde not
haue declared it better, howe that her trust and confidence was in the
death of Iesus Christ, whom she hoped to see in the Celestiall citie,
and so with a ioyfull countenaunce, her eyes erected vp to the heauens,
she rendred her chast body to the earth, and her soule to her Creator:
and when shee was shrouded ready to the buriall, as her neighbours were
attending to followe her to the Church, her poore husbande came home,
and the first sight he sawe, was the body of his dead wife before his
doore, wherof before that instant hee had no newes. And when he
vnderstode the order of her death, he then doubled his sorrowe, in such
wyse that he was also like to die. In this sort was this marter of
chastitie buried in the church of S.&nbsp;Florentine, where all the
honest dames and wiues of the citie endeuoured themselues to accompany
her, and to honour her with suche reuerence as they were able to do:
accomptinge themselues most happie to dwell in that towne, where a woman
of such vertuous behauiour did dwell. The foolish and wanton seing the
honour done to that deade bodye, determined from that time forth to
renue their former life, and to chaunge the same into a better.</p>

THE FIFTY-FIRST NOUELL.</a></h3>

<p class = "summary">
A king of Naples, abusing a Gentleman’s wife, in the end did weare the
hornes himselfe.</p>


<p><span class = "firstword">In</span> the citie of Naples when king
Alphonsus raigned, in whose time wantonnesse bare chiefest sway, there
was a Gentleman so honest, beautifull and comely, as for his good
conditions and wel knowen behauiour an old Gentleman gaue to him his
daughter in mariage, which in beautie and good grace was passingly well
beloued and comfortable to her husband. The Loue was great betwene them,
till it chaunced vpon shrouetide that the king went a masking into the
citie, where euery man endeuoured to intertaine him the best he could.
And when he came to this Gentleman’s house, he was best receyued of any
place in all the towne, aswell for banqueting, as for musicall songes,
and the Gentlewoman, the fayrest that the king sawe in all the citie to
his contentacion. And vpon the end of the banket, she sang a song with
her husbande, with a grace so good as it greatly augmented her beautie.
The king seeing so many perfections in one body, conceyued not so great
pleasure in the sweete accords of her husband and her, as he did howe to
deuise to interrupt and breake them: and the difficultie for bringinge
that to passe, was the great amitie that hee sawe betweene them,
wherefore he bare in his hart that passion so couert, as he possibly
could. But partly for his owne solace and comforte, and partly for good
will of all, hee feasted all the Lords and Ladyes of Naples, where the
Gentleman and his wife were not forgotten. And because man willingly
beleeueth that he doth see, he thought that the lokes of that
gentlewoman promised vnto him some grace in time to come, if the
presence of her husband were no let therunto. And to proue whether his
coniecture were true, he sent her husbande in commission to Rome, for
the space of <span class = "smallroman">XV.</span> dayes or <span class
= "smallroman">III.</span> wekes. And so sone as he was gone, his wyfe
which hitherto had not felt any long absence from her husband, made
great sorrow
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page33" id = "page33">33</a></span>
for the same, whereof she recomforted by the king, many times by sweete
perswasions and by presents and gifts, in such sort, that she was not
onely comforted, but contented with her husbande’s absence. And before
the three weekes were expired of his returne, she was so amorous of the
king as she was no lesse sorowful of his comming home, then she was
before for his departure. And to the intent the king’s presence might
not be loste, they agreed together, that when her husband was gone to
his possessions in the countrie, she should send word to the king, that
he might haue safe repair vnto her, and so secretly that his honour,
(which he feared more then he did the fact) might not be impaired. Vpon
this hope, this Ladie’s hart was set on a merie pin: and when her
husband was come home, shee welcomed him so wel, that albeit he knewe
how the king made much of her in his absence, yet he would not beleeue
that he so did for any dishonest fact. Howbeit by continuance of time,
this fier that could not be couered, by litle and litle began to kindle,
in such wise as the husband doubted much of the truth, and watched the
matter so neere, as he was almost oute of doubt. But for feare, least
the partie which did the wrong, should do him greater hurt, if he seemed
to know it, he determined to dissemble the matter: for he thought it
better to liue with some griefe, then to hazard his life for a woman
that did not loue him: notwithstanding, for this displeasure, he thought
to be euen with the king if it were possible. And knowinge that many
times despite maketh a woman to do that which Loue cannot bring to
passe, specially those that haue honourable harts and stoute stomacks,
was so bold without blushing, vpon a day in speaking to the Queene, to
say unto her, that he had pitie vpon her, for that shee was no better
beloued of the king her husband. The Queene which heard tell of the loue
betwene the king and his wife: “I&nbsp;cannot (quoth she) both enioy
honour and pleasure together: I&nbsp;knowe well that honor I haue,
whereof one receiueth the pleasure, and as she hath the pleasure, so
hath not she the honor.” He which knewe wel by whom those words were
spoken, said vnto her: “Madame, honor hath waited vpon you euen from
your birth, for you be of so good a house, as to be a queene or
Empresse, you cannot
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page34" id = "page34">34</a></span>
augment your nobilitie, but your beautie, grace, and honestie, hath
deserued so much pleasure, as she that depriueth you of that which is
incident to your degree, doth more wrong to her self then to your
person. For she for a glorie that hath turned her to shame, hath
therewithall lost so much pleasure, as your grace or any Lady in the
realme may haue. And I may saye vnto you (Madame) that if the kinge were
no king as he is, I&nbsp;thincke that he could not excel me in pleasing
of a woman: being sure that to satisfie such a vertuous personage as you
be, he might exchaunge his complexion with mine.” The Queene smiling,
answered him: “Although the king be of more delicate and weaker
complexion than you be, yet the loue that he beareth mee, doth so much
content mee, as I esteeme the same aboue all thinges in the world.” The
gentleman said vnto her: “Madame, if it were so, I&nbsp;woulde take no
pitie vpon you, for I know wel that the honest loue of your hart, would
yeld vnto you great contentment, if the like were to be found in the
king: but God hath foreseene and preuented the same, least enioyinge
your owne desire, you would make him your God vppon earth.”
“I&nbsp;confesse vnto you (saide the Queene) that the Loue I beare him,
is so great, as the like place he could not find in no woman’s hart, as
he doth in mine.” “Pardon me, madame (saide the Gentleman) if I speake
more francklye, your grace hath not sounded the depth of ech man’s
harte. For I dare be bold to say vnto you, that I do know one that doth
loue you, and whose loue is so great, as your loue in respecte of his is
nothing. And for so much as he seeth the kinge’s loue to faile in you
his doth grow and increase, in such sort, that if your loue were
agreable vnto his, you should be recompensed of all your losses.” The
Queene aswel by his words as by his countenaunce, began to perceiue,
that the talke proceded from the bottom of his hart, and called to her
remembraunce that long time he had endeuored to do her service, with
such affection, as for loue he was growen to be melancolike, which she
thought before, to rise through his wiue’s occasion, but now she
assuredly beleued that it was for her sake. And thus the force of Loue,
which is well discryed when it is not fayned, made her sure of that,
which was vnknowen to all the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page35" id = "page35">35</a></span>
world. And beholding the gentleman which was more amiable than her
husband, and seing that he was forsaken of his wife, as she of the king,
pressed with despite and ialousie of her husband, and prouoked with loue
of the gentleman, began to say with finger in eye, and sighing sobbs:
“O&nbsp;my God, must vengeaunce get and win that at my hand, which Loue
cannot doe?” The gentleman well vnderstanding her meaning, aunsweared:
“Madame, vengeance is sweete vnto him which in place of killinge an
ennemye, giueth life to a perfecte freinde. I&nbsp;thincke it time that
trouth doe remoue from you the foolishe loue, that you beare to him
which loueth you not: and that iust and reasonable loue should expell
from you the feare, which out not remaine in a noble and vertuous hart.
But now madame, omittinge to speake of the greatnesse of your estate,
let vs consider that we be both man and woman, the most deceiued of the
world, and betrayed of them which we haue most dearely loued. Let vs now
be reuenged (madame) not onely to render vnto them, what they deserue,
but to satisfie the loue which for my part I can no longer beare, except
I should die. And I thincke, that if your harte be not harder than
flinte, or Diamont, it is impossible but you must perceiue som sparke of
fier, which increaseth more than I am able to dissemble: and if pitie of
me which dieth for your loue, doth not moue you to loue me, at least
wyse let loue of your self constraine you, which (being so perfect a
creature as you&nbsp;be) doth deserue to enioy the hartes of the noblest
and most vertuous of the world. Suffer I say, the contempt and forsaking
of him, [to] moue you, for whom you haue disdayned al other persons.”
The Queene hearing those wordes, was so rauished, as for feare to
declare by her countenaunce the trouble of her spirite, leaning vppon
the Gentleman’s arme, went into a garden hard by her Chamber, where she
walked a long time not able to speake a woord. But the Gentleman seeing
her halfe wonne, when he was at the ende of the Alley where none could
see them, hee certified her by effect, the loue which so long time he
kept secrete from her. And both with one consent reioyced in reuenge,
whereof the passion was importable. And there determined, that so oft as
hee went into the Country, and the king
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page36" id = "page36">36</a></span>
from his Castell into the Citie, he should retourne to the Castel to see
the Quene. Thus deceyuing the deceyuers, all foure were partakers of the
pleasure, which two alone thought to enioy. The accord made, they
departed, the Lady to her Chamber, and the Gentleman to his house, with
such contentacion, as they had quite forgotten al theyr troubles past.
And the feare which either of them had of the assembly of the king and
of the Gentlewoman, was tourned to desire, which made the Gentleman to
go more oft then he was wonte to doe into the countrye, being not past
halfe a mile of. And so sone as the king knew therof, he fayled not to
visite his Lady, and the gentleman the night following went to the
Castle to salute the Queene, to do the office of the kinge’s
Lieutenaunt, so secretly as no man did perceiue it. This voyage endured
long time, but the king because he was a publike person, could not so
well dissemble his Loue, but all the worlde did vnderstand it, and all
men pitied the gentleman’s state. For diuers light persons behinde his
backe would make hornes vnto him, in signe of mockerie, which he right
well perceyued. But this mockerie pleased him so wel, as he esteemed his
hornes better then the king’s Crowne. The king and the Gentleman’s wife
one day, could not refraine (beholding a Stagge’s head set vp in the
Gentleman’s house) from breaking into a laughter before his face,
saying, how that head became the house very well. The gentleman that had
so good a hart as he, wrote ouer that head these words.</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p><i>These hornes I weare and beare for euery man to view,</i></p>
<p><i>But yet I weare them not in token they be trew.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The king retourning againe to the Gentleman’s house, finding this
title newlye written, demaunded of the gentleman the signification of
them.</p>

<p>Who said vnto him:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p><i>“If princesse secret things, be from the horned hart
concealed,</i></p>
<p><i>Why should like things of horned beastes, to Princes be
revealed.</i></p>
</div>

<p>But content your selfe: all they that weare hornes be pardoned to
weare their capps vpon their heads: for they be so sweete and pleasaunt,
as they vncappe no man, and they weare them so light, as they thincke
they haue none at all.” The king knew well by
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page37" id = "page37">37</a></span>
his wordes that he smelled something of his doings, but he neuer
suspected the loue betwene the Queene and him. For the Queene was better
contented wyth her husbande’s life, and with greater ease dissembled her
griefe. Wherefore eyther parts lived long time in this loue, till age
had taken order for dissolucion thereof. “Behold Ladyes (quoth
Saffredante) this Historye which for example I have willinglye recited
to thintente that when your husbands do make you hornes as big as a
Goate, you maye render unto him the monstrous heade of a Stagge.” “Peace
(quoth Emarsuite smyling) no more wordes, least you reuiue some sleeping
sweet soule, which without stur would not awake; with any
whispring.”</p>

<p class = "summary">
The rashe enterprise of a Gentleman against a Princesse of Flaunders,
and of the shame that he receyued thereof.</p>


<p><span class = "firstword">There</span> was in Flaunders a Lady of an
honorable house, which had two husbands, by whom shee had no children
that were then liuinge. Duringe the time of her widowhoode shee dwelte
within one of her brothers, that loued her very well, which was a noble
man, and had maried a king’s doughter. This yong Prince was muche giuen
to pleasure, louinge huntinge, pastime, and the company of fayre Ladyes,
accordingly as youth requireth. He had a wyfe that was curst and
troublesome, whom the delectations of her husband in no wyse did
contente and please: wherefore this noble man caused his sister daily to
keepe company with his wyfe. This Gentlewoman his sister was of
pleasaunt conuersation, and therewithal very honest and wyse. There was
in the house of this noble man, a&nbsp;Gentleman whose worship, beautye
and grace did surpasse all the rest of his companions. This Gentleman
perceyuing the sister of his Lorde and Maister to be pleasaunte and of
ioyfull countenaunce, thoughte to proue if the attempt of an honest
frende would be vouchsaued, but he founde her aunswere to be contrary to
her countenaunce: and albeit that her aunswere was such as was meete for
a Princesse and right honest Gentlewoman, yet because she perceyued him
to be a goodly personage, and curteous, she easily pardoned his bold
attempt, and seemed that she toke it not in ill part when he spake vnto
her. Neuerthelesse shee warned him, after that time, to moue no such
matter, which he promised, because he would not lose his pleasure, and
the honour that hee conceyued to entertaine her. Notwithstanding, by
processe of time his affection increased so much as he forgot the
promise which he had made her, wherefore he thoughte good not to hazarde
his enterprise by wordes, for that hee had to long against his wyll
experimented her wyse and discrete aunsweares: and therewithall he
thought if he could
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page39" id = "page39">39</a></span>
finde her in some conueient place (because she was a yong widow, of
lusty yeares and good complexion) it were possible shee woulde take
pitie vppon him, and of herself. And that he might bring his purpose to
effecte, he said to his Maister that he had besides his owne house very
goodlie game, and that if it pleased him to kill three or foure Stagges
in the moneth of May, he should see very good pastime. The Lord aswell
for the loue hee bare to the Gentleman, as for the pleasure he had in
hunting, graunted his request: and went to his house, which was so faire
and well furnished, as the best Gentleman in all the countrey had no
better. The gentleman lodged his Lord and Lady in one side of the house,
and in the other directly against it her whome he loued better than
himselfe. The Chamber where his maistres laye, was so well hanged with
tapistrie, and so trimely matted, as it was impossible to perceiue a
falling dore, harde by the bed’s side, descending to his mother’s
chamber, which was an old Lady, much troubled with the Catarre and Rume.
And because she had a cough, fearing to disease the Princesse which laye
aboue her, she chaunged her chamber with her sonne. And euery night the
olde Gentlewoman brought comficts to the Lady for her recreation, vpon
whom the Gentleman wayted, who (for that he was well beloued and very
familier with her brother) was not refused to be present at her rising
and going to bedde. Whereby he daily toke occasion to increase his loue
and affection: in suche sorte as one night, after he had caused the
Ladye to sit vp late, (she being surprised with sleepe) he was forced to
depart the chamber, and to repaire to his own. Wher when he had put on
the most brauest perfumed shirt that he had, and his cap for the night
so trimmely dressed, as there wanted nothing, he thought in beholding
himself, that there was no Lady in the world that would refuse his
beautie and comlinesse. Wherefore promising himselfe a happie successe
in his enterprise, hee went to his bed where he purposed not long to
abide, for the desire that he had to enter into another, whiche should
be more honourable and pleasaunt vnto him. And after he had sent his men
away, he rose to shut the dore after them, and hearkened a good while,
whether he could heare any noyse in the Ladie’s chamber aboue. And when
he was
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page40" id = "page40">40</a></span>
sure that euery man was at rest, he began to take his pleasaunt iourney,
and by litle and litle opened the falling dore, whiche was so well
trimmed with cloth, that it made no noyse at all, and went vp to the
Ladie’s bed side, which then was in her first sleepe, and without
respecte of the bonde and promise that he made vnto her, or the
honorable house wherof she came, without leaue or reuerence, he laid
himselfe down besides her, who felt him betwene her armes before she
perceiued his comming. But she which was somewhat strong, vnfolded her
self out of his handes, and in asking him what he was, began to strike,
to bite and scratche, in suche wyse, as he was constrained (for feare
least she should crye out) to stoppe her mouth with the couerlet, which
was impossible for him to do. For when she sawe him to presse with all
his force to despoyle her of her honor, she spared no part of her might
to defende and kepe her selfe, and called (so&nbsp;loude as she could)
her woman of honor, that laye in her chamber, whiche was a very auncient
and sober gentlewoman, who in her smock, ran straight to her maistresse.
And when the Gentleman perceiued that hee was discouered, hee was so
fearfull to be knowen of the Ladye, as sone as he could hee shifted
himself down by his trapdore. And where before he conceiued hope and
assuraunce to be welcome, now he was brought in despaire for retourning
in so vnhappy state. When he was in his chamber, he found his glasse and
candle vpon the table, and beholding his face all bloudy with the
scratchings and bitinges, whiche shee had bestowed vpon him, the bloud
wherof ran down his fayre shyrt, better bloudied then gilted, he began
to make his moone in this wise: “O&nbsp;beautie, thou art nowe payed thy
desert, for vppon thy vayne promise haue I aduentured a thing
impossible. And that which might haue bene the augmenting of my delight
is nowe the redoubling of my sorowe. Being assured that if she knewe
howe contrary to my promise I haue enterprised this foolishe fact,
I&nbsp;should vtterly forgoe the honest and common conuersation whiche I
haue with her aboue al other. That which my estimation, beautie and good
behauiour doe deserue, I&nbsp;ought not to hyde in darkenesse. To gaine
her loue, I&nbsp;ought not to haue assayed her chaste bodye by force,
but rather by seruice and humble pacience, to wayte and attend till
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page41" id = "page41">41</a></span>
loue did vanquishe. For without loue all the vertue and puissance of man
is of no power and force.” Euen thus he passed the night in such teares,
griefes and plaintes, as can not be well reported and vttered. In the
morning, when he beheld his bloudy face all mangled and torne, he fained
to be very sicke, and that he could abide no light, til the company were
gone from his house. The Ladye whiche thus remained victorious, knowing
that there was no man in all her brother’s Court, that durst attempt a
deede so wicked, but her hoste which was so bolde to declare his loue
vnto her, knew well that it was he. And when she and her woman of honour
had searched all the corners of the chamber to knowe what he was, and
could not finde hym, she sayd vnto her woman in great rage: “Assure your
selfe it can be none other, but the Gentleman of the house, whose
villanous order I wyll reueale to my brother in the morning, in such
sorte, as his head shalbe a witnesse and testimony of my chastitie.” Her
woman seing her in that furie, sayd vnto her; “Madame, I&nbsp;am right
glad to see the loue and affection which you beare to your honor, for
the increase wherof you doe not spare the life of one, which hath
aduentured himselfe so muche for the loue that hee beareth vnto you. But
many times such one thinketh by those meanes to increase loue, which
altogether he doth diminishe. Wherefore (Madame) I&nbsp;humbly beseche
you to tell me the truthe of this facte.” And when the Ladie had
recompted the same at lengthe, the woman of honour sayd vnto her: “Your
grace doth say that he got no other thyng of you, but scratches and
blowes with your fistes.” “No, I&nbsp;assure you (quod the Ladie) and I
am certaine if hee gette hym not a good Surgeon, the markes will be
seene to morowe.” “Wel Madame (quod the gentlewoman) sithens it is so,
me thinketh you haue greater occasion to prayse <span class =
"smallcaps">God</span>, then to muse vpon reuenge: For you may beleue,
that sithens he had the courage to enterprise so great an exploit, and
that despite hath failed him of his purpose, you can deuise no greater
death for him to suffer, then the same. If you desire to be reuenged,
let Loue and shame alone bring that to passe, who knowe better which way
to tormente him than your selfe, and with greater honor to your persone.
Take heede Madame from falling into such inconuenience as he is in, for
in
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page42" id = "page42">42</a></span>
place of great pleasure whiche he thought to haue gayned, he hath
receiued the extremest anoyance, that any gentleman can suffer. And you
Madame, by thinking to augment your honor, you may decrease and diminish
the same. And by making complaint, you shal cause that to be knowen,
which no man knoweth. For of his part (you may be assured) there shall
neuer be anything reuealed. And when my Lorde your brother at your
requeste, shall execute the iustice which you desire, and that the poore
Gentleman shal be ready to die, the brute will runne that he hath had
his pleasure vpon you. And the greatest numbre will say, that it is very
difficult for a Gentleman to doe suche an enterprise, except the Lady
minister some great occasion. Your grace is faire and yong, frequenting
your life in pleasant company, there is none in all the Court, but seeth
and marketh the good countenaunce you beare to that Gentleman, whereof
your selfe hath some suspicion: which will make euery man suppose that
if he hath done this enterprise, it was not without some consent from
you. And your honor which hetherto hath borne your port a loft, shall be
disputed vpon in all places where this historie shall be remembred.” The
Princesse well waying the good reasons and aduise of her gentlewoman,
knewe that she spake the truthe: and that by moste iust cause she should
be blamed: considering the familiaritie and good countenaunce which
dayly she bare vnto the Gentleman. Wherefore she inquired of her woman
of honour, what was beste to bee done. Who aunswered her thus. “Madame,
sith it pleaseth you to receiue mine aduise, by waying the affection
whereof it procedeth, me thinke you ought in your hart to reioyce, that
the goodliest, and moste curteous Gentleman that liueth, could neither
by loue, or force, despoile you of your greatest vertue and chastitie.
For which (Madame) you are bounde to humble your selfe before God,
acknowledging that it is not done by your vertue, bicause many women
walking in a more paineful and more vnpleasaunt trade then you do, haue
humiliated and brought low by men farre more vnworthy of loue, then he
which loueth you. And ye ought now to feare more than euer you did, to
vse any semblance and take of amitie, bicause there haue bene many that
haue fallen the second time into daungers and perils, which they haue
auoyded at the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page43" id = "page43">43</a></span>
first. Remember (Madame) that loue is blind, who blaseth mens eyes in
such sort, as where a man thinketh the waye moste sure, ther his most
readie to fal. And I suppose Madame, that you ought not to seme to be
priuie of this chaunce, neither to him, ne yet to any els, and when he
remembreth anye thing to you, doe make as though you did not vnderstande
his meaning, to auoyde twoo daungers. The one of vaine glorie for the
victorie you haue had, the other to take pleasure in remembring things,
that be so pleasaunt to the flesh, which the most chaste haue had much a
do to defend theimselues from feling some sparkes, although they seke
meanes to shunne and auoyde them with all their possible power.
Moreouer, Madame, to thende that he thinke not by suche hazard and
enterprise to haue done a thing agreable to your minde, my counsell is,
that by litle and litle, you doe make your selfe straunge, and vse no
more your wonted grace vnto him, that he may know how much you despise
his folly and consider how great your goodnesse is, by contenting your
self with the victory which God hath geuen you, without seeking any
further vltion or reuengement. And God graunt you grace (Madame) to
continue that honestie which hee hath planted in your hart, and by
acknowledging that all goodnesse procedeth from him, you may loue him
and serue him, better than euer ye did.” The Princesse determined to
credite the counsayle of her gentlewoman, slepte with so great ioye as
the poore gentleman waked with sorrow. On the morrow the noble man ready
to depart, asked for his hoste, vnto whom answere was made that he was
so sicke, as he could not abide the light, or endure to heare one
speake. Wherof the Prince was sore abashed, and would haue visited him,
but that it was told him he was a slepe, and was very loth to wake him.
Wherefore without bidding him farewell, he departed, taking with him his
wife and sister, who hearing the excuse of the Gentleman that would not
see the Prince, nor yet his companie, at their departure, was persuaded
that it was he, that had done her al that torment, and durst not shew
the markes which she had signed in his face. And although his Maister
did sende oftimes for him yet came he not to the Court, vntill he was
healed of his woundes, except that whiche loue and despite had made in
his harte. When he came to the Courte and appeared
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page44" id = "page44">44</a></span>
before his victorious enemie, he blushed for shame of his ouer throwe.
And he which was the stoutest of all the company was so astonned as many
times being in her presence, hee could not tell which way to loke or
tourne his face. Wherfore she was assured that her suspicion was certain
and true, by litle and litle estraunging her self from him, but it was
not done so sleightly or politikely but that he perceiued well enough,
and yet he durst make no semblaunce, for feare of worse aduenture.
Notwithstanding he conserued both loue in his hart, and pacience in his
minde, for the losse of his Ladie’s fauour, which he had right well
deserued.</p>

<p class = "summary">
The loue of Amadour and Florinda: wherein be conteined mani sleightes
and dissimulations, together with the renowmed chastitie of the said
Florinda.</p>


<p><span class = "firstword">In</span> the Countie of Arande, in Aragon,
a region in Spaine, there was a Ladie whiche in the best time of her
youth, continued the widow of the Earle of Arande, with one sonne, and
one daughter, called Florinda. The sayde Lady brought vp her children in
all vertue and honestie, meete and conuenable for Lordes and Gentlemen,
in such sorte, as her house was renowmed to be one of the most honorable
in all the Region of Spaine. Many times she repaired to Tolledo, where
the kinge of Spaine helde his Court, and when she came to Sarragosa,
which was harde adioyning to the court, she continued long with the
Queene, and in the Courte, where she was had in so good estimation as
any Lady might be. Vpon a time going towardes the king, according to her
custome, which was at Sarragosa, in his castle of Iafferie, this Lady
passed by a village that belonged to the Viceroy of Catalongne, who
still continued vppon the frontiers of Parpignon, for the great warres
that were betwene the Frenche king and him. Howebeit, at that time peace
being concluded, the Viceroy with all his captaines were come to do
reuerence to the king. The Viceroy knowing that the Countesse of Arrande
did passe through his countrie, went to mete her, as well for auncient
amitie, as for the honor he bare vnto her being allied to the kyng. Nowe
this Viceroy had in his companye diuers honest Gentlemen, whiche through
the frequentation and continuance of the long warres, had gotten suche
honour and fame, as euery man that might see them and behold them did
accompt them selues happy. But amonges all other, there was one called
Amadour, who although he was but <span class =
"smallroman">XVIII.</span> or <span class = "smallroman">XIX.</span>
yeares of age, yet he had such an assured grace and witte so excellent,
as he was demed amongs a thousand persones worthy to haue the
gouernement of a common wealth, whiche good witte was coupled with
maruellous naturall beautie, so that there
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page46" id = "page46">46</a></span>
was no eye, but did content it self eftsones to beholde hym. And this
beautie so exquisite, was associated with wonderfull eloquence, as
doubtfull to say, whether merited greatest honor, either his grace and
beautie, or his excellent tongue. But that which brought him into best
reputation, was his great hardinesse, whereof the common reporte and
brute was nothing impeached or staied for all his youth. For in so many
places he shewed his chiualrie, as not only Spain but Fraunce and
Italie, did singularly commend and set forth his vertue: bicause in all
the warres wherin he was present, he neuer spared him self for any
daunger. And when his countrie was in peace and quiet, he sought to
serue in straunge places, being loued and estemed both of his frendes
and enemies. This Gentleman for the loue of his Captaine was come into
that countrey, where was arriued the Countesse of Arande, and in
beholding the beautie and good grace of her daughter, which was not then
past <span class = "smallroman">XII.</span> yeres of age, he thought
that she was the fairest and most vertuous personage that euer he sawe:
and that if he could obtaine her good will, he should be so well
satisfied as if he had gained all the goods and pleasures of the worlde.
And after he had a good whyle viewed her, for all the impossibilitie
that reason could deuise to the contrary, he determined to loue her,
although some occasion of that impossibilitie might ryse through the
greatnesse of the house wherof she came, and for want of age which was
not able as yet to vnderstande the passions of loue. But against the
feare thereof he was armed with good hope, persuading himselfe, that
time and patience would bring happie ende to his trauayle: and from that
time gentle Loue whiche without any other occasion than by his own force
was entred the harte of Amadour, promised him fauour and helpe by all
meanes possible to attaine the same. And to prouide for the greatest
difficultie, which was the farre distance of the countrie wher he dwelt,
and the small occasion that he had thereby any more to see Florinda, he
thought to marry against his determination made with the ladies of
Barselone and Parpignon, amonges whom he was so conuersant by reason of
the warres, as he semed rather to be a Cathelan, than a Castillan,
although he wer borne by Tollede, of a riche and honourable house, yet
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page47" id = "page47">47</a></span>
bicause he was a yonger brother, he inioyed no great patrimonie or
reuenue. Notwithstanding, loue and fortune seing him forsaken of his
parentes, determined to accomplishe some notable exployt in him, and
gaue him (by&nbsp;meanes of his vertue) that which the lawes of his
countrey refused to geue. He had good experience in factes of warre, and
was so well beloued of al Princes and Rulers, as he refused many times
their goodes, being resolued not to care or esteme the benefites of
Fortune. The Countesse of whome I spake, arriued thus at Saragossa, was
very well intertained of the king, and of his whole Court. The Gouernour
of Catalogne, many times came thither to visite her, whom Amadour neuer
failed to accompany, for the onely pleasure he had to talke with
Florinda: and to make himselfe to be knowen in the company, hee went to
Auenturade, whiche was the daughter of an old knight that dwelt hard by
the house, whiche from her youth was brought vp with Florinda, in such
familiar sorte, as she knewe all the secrets of her harte. Amadour, as
well for the honestie that he found in her, as for the liuing of <span
class = "smallroman">III.M.</span> ducates by the yeare which she should
haue with her in mariage, determined to geue her such intertaignement,
as one that was disposed to marry her. Wherunto the gentlewoman did
willingly recline her eare: and bicause he was poore, and the father of
the damosell rich, she thought that her father would neuer accorde to
the mariage, except it were by meanes of the Countesse of Arande.
Wherupon she went to madame Florinda, and saide vnto her: “Madame, you
see this Castillan gentleman, which so oftentimes talketh with me,
I&nbsp;doe beleue that his pretence is to marry me: you do know what a
father I haue, who will neuer geue his consent, if he be not persuaded
therunto by my Lady your mother and you.” Florinda which loued the
damosell as her selfe, assured her that shee would take vpon her to
bring that matter to passe, with so earnest trauaile as if the case were
her own. Then Auenturade brought Amadour before Florinda, who after he
had saluted her, was like to fall in a sowne for ioy, and although he
were compted the moste eloquent persone of Spaine, yet was he now become
mute and dumb before Florinda, wherat she maruelled much: for albeit she
was but <span class = "smallroman">XII.</span> yeares of age, yet she
vnderstode that there was no
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page48" id = "page48">48</a></span>
man in Spaine that had a better tongue, or a more conuenable grace than
he. And seing that he said nothing vnto her, she spake vnto him in this
wise: “The fame which is bruted of you (sir Amadour) throughout the
whole countrie of Spaine, is such as it maketh you knowen and estemed in
this company, and giueth desire and occasion to those that know you, to
imploy themselues to do you pleasure: wherefore if there be any thing
wherin I may gratifie you, vse me I besech you.” Amadour that gased vpon
the beautie of that lady, was rapt and surprised, not well able to
render thankes vnto her. And although Florinda maruelled to see him
without aunswere, yet she imputed it rather to bashfulnesse than to any
force of loue, and departed without further talke. Amadour knowing the
vertue which in so tender yeares began to appeare in Florinda, saide
vnto her whome he purposed to marry: “Doe not maruell, though my speache
do fayle before Madame Florinda, for the vertues and discretion, hidden
in that yonge personage, did so amase mee, as I wiste not what to saye:
but I praye you Auenturade (quod&nbsp;he) who knoweth all her secretes,
to tell me, if it be otherwyse possible, but that she hath the harte of
all the Lordes and Gentlemen of the Court: for they which know her and
doe not loue her, be stones, or beastes.” Auenturade whiche then loued
Amadour more than all the men in the worlde, and would conceale nothing
from him, said vnto him: that Madame Florinda was generally beloued: but
for the custome of the countrie, fewe men did speake unto her. “And
(quod she) as yet I se none that make any semblance of loue vnto her,
but two young Princes of Spaine, which desire to marry her, whereof the
one is the sonne of the Infant Fortune, and the other of the Duke of
Cadouce.” “I&nbsp;praye you then (quod Amadour) to tell me which of them
as you think, doth loue her best.” “She is so wise” said Auenturade,
“that she will confesse or graunt her loue to none, but to such as her
mother pleaseth. But yet so far as we can iudge she fauoureth muche
better the sonne of the Infant Fortune, than the Duke of Cadouce: and
for that I take you to be a man of good iudgment, this day you shall
haue occasion to consider the truth: for the sonne of the Infant Fortune
is brought vp in Court, and is one of the goodliest and perfectest
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page49" id = "page49">49</a></span>
yong Gentlemen in al christendome: and if the mariage do procede,
according to our opinion, which be her women, he shalbe assured to haue
Madame Florinda: and then shalbe ioyned together the goodliest couple in
the world. And you must vnderstand, that although they be both very
yong, she of <span class = "smallroman">XII.</span> yeares of age, and
he of <span class = "smallroman">XV.</span> yet is there three yeares
past since their loue first began: and if you be disposed aboue other to
obtain her fauour, mine aduise is, that ye become friend and seruaunt
vnto him.” Amadour was very ioyfull to heare tell that his Lady loued
some man, trusting that in tyme he should wynne the place, not of
husbande, but of seruaunt: for he feared nothing at all of her vertue,
but a lacke of disposition to loue. And after this communication,
Amadour bent himselfe to haunt the societie of the sonne of the Infant
Fortune, whose good will he sone recouered, for all the pastimes whiche
the yong Prince loued, Amadour could doe right well: and aboue other, he
was very cunning in riding of horsses, and in handling al kindes of
armes and weapons, and in all other pastimes and games meete for a yong
Gentleman. Warres began in Languedoc, and Amadour was forced to retire
with the Gouernour, to his great sorrowe and grief, for he had there no
meane to returne to the place where he might se Florinda. For which
cause he spake to his owne brother, whiche was Steward of the king of
Spaine’s houshold, and declared vnto him what courtesie he had found in
the house of the Countesse of Arande, and of the damosel Auenturade:
praying him that in his absence he would do his indeuour, that the
mariage might proceede, and that he would obtaine for him the credit and
good opinion of the king and Queene, and of al his friendes. The
Gentleman which loued his brother, as well by nature’s instigation, as
for his great vertues, promised him his trauaile and industrie to the
vttermoste. Which he did in such wise as the old man her father, nowe
forgetting other naturall respect, began to marke and beholde the
vertues of Amadour, which the Countesse of Arande, and specially faire
Florinda, painted and set foorth vnto him, and likewyse the Yong earl of
Arande whiche increased in yeares, and therewithall in loue of those
that were vertuous, and geuen to honest exercise. And when the mariage
was agreed
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page50" id = "page50">50</a></span>
betweene the parentes, the said Steward sent for his brother whilest the
truce endured betwene the two kings. About this time, the king of Spain
retired to Madric, to auoyd the euil aire that was in many places, where
by the aduise of diuers of his counsell, and at the request of the
Countesse of Arande, he made a mariage betwene the yong Duchesse the
heire of Medina Celi, and the yong Earle of Arande, as wel for the vnion
of their house, as also for the loue he bare to the said Countesse. And
this mariage was celebrated in the Castell of Madric, whereunto repaired
Amadour, who so well obtained his suite, as he maried her, of whom he
was muche better beloued, than his smal loue toward her deserued, sauing
that it was a couerture and meanes for him to frequent the place where
his minde and delight incessantly remained: after he was maried, he
became well acquainted and familiar in the house of the Countesse, so
that he was so conuersaunt amonges the Ladies, as if he had bene a
woman: and although hee was then but <span class =
"smallroman">XXII.</span> yeares of age, he was so wise and graue, as
the Countesse imparted vnto him all her affaires, commaunding her sonne
and daughter to intertayne him, and to credite all thinges wherein hee
gaue counsell. Hauing wonne this great estimation, he behaued him selfe
so wyse and politike, that euen the partie whiche he loued knewe no
parte of his affection: but by reason of the loue that Florinda bare to
the wife of Amadour, whome shee loued more than any other woman, she was
so familiar with him, as shee dissembled no part of her thought,
declaring vnto him all the loue that she bare the sonne of the Infant
Fortune: and he that desired nothing more than throughly to winne her,
ceassed not from continuance of talke, not caring whereof he spake, so
that he might hold her with long discourse: Amadour had not after his
mariage continued a moneth in that companie, but was constrained to
retire to the warres, where hee continued more than twoo yeares, without
retourne to see his wife, who still abode in the place where she was
brought vp. During the time, Amadour wrote many letters vnto his wife,
but the chiefest substance therof consisted in commendations to
Florinda, who for her part failed not to render like vnto him, many
times writing some pretie worde or posie with her own hand, in the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page51" id = "page51">51</a></span>
letter of Auenturade. Which made her husband Amadour diligent many times
to write again vnto her, but in al this doing Florinda conceiued
nothing, but that he loued her with such like loue as the brother oweth
to the sister. Many times Amadour went and came, but in the space of
fiue yeares he neuer sawe Florinda twoo monethes together:
notwithstanding, Loue in despite of their distaunce and long absence,
ceassed not to increase: and it chaunced that hee made a voyage home to
see his wyfe, and founde the Countesse farre from the court, bicause the
kyng of Spain was done to Vandelousie, and had taken with him the yong
Earle of Arande, whiche then began to bere armes. The Countesse was
retired to a house of pleasure, which shee had vpon the frontiers of
Arragon and Nauarre, and was right ioyfull when shee see Amadour, who
almoste three yeares had bene absent. He was very well recieued of euery
man, and the countesse commaunded that he should be vsed and entreated
as her howne sonne. During the time that he soiourned with her, she
communicated vnto him all the affaires of her house, and committed the
greatest trust thereof to his discretion, who wan such credite in the
house as in all places where he liste, the dores were opened vnto him:
whose wysedome and good behauiour made him to be estemed like a Sainct
or Aungell. Florinda, for the loue and good wyll she bare unto his wyfe
and him, made muche of him in all places where she sawe him: and
therfore tooke no hede vnto his countenaunce, for that her hart as yet
felt no passion, but a certen contentation in her selfe, when she was in
the presence of Amadour, and of any other thing she thought not. Amadour
to auoyde the iudgement of them that haue proued the difference of
Louers countenaunces, was very ware and circumspect: for when Florinda
came to speake vnto hym secretly (like one that thought no hurt) the
fier hydden in his breste, burned so sore, as he could not staye the
blushyng colour of his face, nor the sparkes whiche flewe out of his
eyes: and to the intent, that through long frequentation, none might
espie the same, he intertaigned a very fayre Ladye called Paulina,
a&nbsp;woman in his tyme accompted so fayre, as fewe men whiche behelde
her, coulde escape her bondes<ins class = "correction" title = ", for .">,
</ins>This Ladye Paulina vnderstanding howe Amadour vsed his Loue
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page52" id = "page52">52</a></span>
at Barselone and Parpignon, and how he was beloued of the fayrest Ladies
of the Countrie, and aboue all of the Countesse of Palamons, whiche in
beautie was prysed to be the fayrest in all Spayne, and of many other,
sayde vnto hym: “That shee had great pitie of hym, for that after so
manye good Fortunes, he had maried a wyfe so foule and deformed.”
Amadour vnderstanding well by those woordes, that she had desyre to
remedy her owne necessitie, vsed the best maner he coulde deuise, to the
intent that in makyng her beleue a lye, he should hyde from her the
truthe. But shee subtile and well experimented in Loue, was not contente
with talke, but perceyuing well that his harte was not satisfied with
her Loue, doubted that hee coulde not serue his Lady in secrete wise,
and therefore marked hym so nere, as daylye she had a respecte and
watche vnto hys eyes, whiche hee coulde so well dissemble, as she was
able to iudge nothyng, but by darke suspicion, not without great payne
and difficultie to the Gentleman, to whome Florinda (ignoraunt of all
their malice) dyd resorte many tymes in presence of Paulina, whose
demeaner then was so familiar, as he with maruellous payne refrayned his
lookes against his harte and desire: and to auoyde that no inconuenience
should ensue, one daye speaking to Florinda, as they were both leaning
at a wyndow, sayd these words: “Madame, I&nbsp;beseche you to tell mee
whether it is better to speake or to die.” Whereunto Florinda answered
readily, saying, “I&nbsp;will euer geue councell to my frendes to speake
and not to dye: for there be fewe wordes spoken but that they may be
amended, but the life lost cannot be recouered.” “Promise me then” said
Amadour, “that not onely ye will accept those wordes which I will say,
but also not to be astonned or abashed, till ye haue heard the end of my
tale.” To whom she aunswered: “Say what it please you, for if you do
affray me none other shall assure me.” Then he began to saye vnto her:
“Madame, I&nbsp;haue not yet bene desirous to disclose vnto you the
great affection which I beare you, for twoo causes: the one, bicause I
attend by my long seruice, to shewe you the experience thereof: the
other, for that I doubted you would thinke a great presumption in me
(which am but a poore gentleman) to insinuate my selfe in place whereof
I am not worthy: and although
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page53" id = "page53">53</a></span>
I were a Prince as you be, the loyaltie yet of your harte, will not
permitte any other, but him which hath already taken possession (the
sonne I meane of the Infant Fortune) to vse in talke any matter of loue:
but Madame, like as necessitie in time of great warr constraineth men to
make hauoke of their owne goodes, and to consume the greene corne, that
the enemy take no profit and reliefe thereof, euen so doe I hazard to
aduaunce the frute, which in time I hope to gather, that your enemies
and mine may inioye thereof none aduauntage. Knowe ye Madame, that from
the time of your tender yeares, I&nbsp;haue in such wyse dedicated my
selfe to your seruice as I ceasse not still to aspire the meanes to
achieue your grace and fauour: and for that occasion, I&nbsp;did marry
her whome I thought you did loue best: and knowing the loue you beare to
the sonne of the Infant Fortune, I&nbsp;haue indeuoured to serue him as
you haue sene: and that wherein I thought you dyd delighte, I&nbsp;haue
accomplished to the vttermoste of my power. You doe see that I haue
gotten the good wil of the Countesse your mother, of the Earle your
brother, and of all those that doe beare you good wyll: in sutche sorte
as in this house I am estemed, not like a seruaunt, but as a sonne: and
all the labour whiche I haue sustayned these fiue yeares past, was for
none other cause, but to lyue all the daies of my life with you: and
vnderstand you wel that I am none of those whiche by these meanes doe
pretende to receiue of you anye profite or pleasure, other than that
which is good and vertuous: I&nbsp;do know that I can neuer marrie you,
and if I could I would not for letting the loue that you beare vnto him,
whom I desire to be your husbande, likewise to loue you in vicious
sorte, like them that hope to recompence their seruice with dishonour of
their Ladies, I&nbsp;am so farre of from that affection, as I had rather
be dead than to see you by desert worthy of lesse loue, and that your
vertue shoulde by any meanes be diminished for any pleasure that might
happen vnto mee. I&nbsp;do pretend and craue for the ende and recompence
of my service, but one thing: which is, that you will continue my loyall
and faithfull maistresse, neuer to withdrawe from me your wonted grace
and fauour, and that you will maintaine mee in that estate wherein I am.
Reposinge your trust and fidelitie in me more than in any other, making
your selfe so
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page54" id = "page54">54</a></span>
assured of me, as if for your honor or any cause touching your person,
you stand in neede of the life of a Gentleman, the same shal right
willingly be employed at your commaundement: in like maner all thinges
vertuous and honest which euer I shal attempt I beseech you to thinke to
be done onely for the loue of you: and if I haue done for Ladies of
lesse reputacion than you be, any thing worthy of regard, be assured
that for such a maistresse as you be, my enterprises shal increase in
such sort, as the things which I found difficult and impossible, shall
be easelie for me to accomplishe; but if you do not accept mee to be
wholy yours, I&nbsp;determine to giue ouer armes, and to renounce
valiaunce, because it hath not succoured me in necessitie: wherfore,
Madame, I&nbsp;humblie beseech you that my iust request may not be
refused, sith with your honour and conscience you cannot well denie the
same.” The yong Lady hearing this vnaccustomed sute, began to chaunge
her colour, and to caste downe her eyes like an amased woman,
notwithstandinge, being wyse and discrete she said vnto him: “If
(Amadour) your request vnto me be none other than you pretende,
wherefore have you discoursed this long Oration? I&nbsp;am afraid lest
vnder this honeste pretence there lurketh some hidden malice to deceiue
the ignoraunce of my youth, wherby I am wrapt in great perplexitie how
to make you aunswere: for to refuse the honest amitie which you haue
offered, I&nbsp;shall doe contrary to that I haue done hitherto, for I
haue reposed in you more trust than in any liuing creature: my
conscience or mine honour cannot gainesay your demaunde, nor the loue
that I beare to the sonne of the Infant Fortune, which is grounded vpon
fayth of mariage: where you say that you pretende nothinge but that is
good and vertuous, I&nbsp;cannot tell what thing should let me to make
you aunswere according to your request, but a feare that I conceiue in
hart, founded vpon the small occasion that you haue to vse that speache,
for if you haue alreadye what you demaunde, what doth constraine you to
speake so affectuouslie?” Amadour that was not without an aunsweare,
said vnto her: “Madame, you speake very wisely, and you do me so much
honour, for the confidence and truste which according to your sayinge
you do repose in me, as if I doe not content my selfe with such a
benefite, I&nbsp;were the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page55" id = "page55">55</a></span>
vnworthiest man aliue: but vnderstande Madame, that he which goeth about
to builde a perpetual mansion, ought to haue regard to a sure and firme
foundacion: wherfore I which desire perpetually to remaine your
seruaunte, doe seeke not onely the meanes to kepe my selfe neare about
you, but also to foresee that none doe vnderstand the great affection
that I do beare you: for although my mind be so vertuous and honest, as
the same may disclose it selfe before the whole worlde, yet there bee
some so ignorant and vnskilfull of louers harts, as manye times will
iudge contrary to trouth, wherof proceedeth so ill brute and report, as
if the effectes were wicked: the cause which hath made me so bold to say
and declare vnto you thus much, is the suspicion that Paulina hath
conceyued, for that I cannot loue her: who doth nothing els but marke
and espie my countenaunce in euerye place, and when you vse your
familiar talke with me before her, I&nbsp;am so afraide to shewe any
signe whereby shee maye grounde or verifie her iudgemente, that I fall
into that inconuenience, which I would willingly auoyde: wherefore I
haue thought good to beseech you (before her and those which you do know
to be so malicious) to refraine from talkinge with mee so sodainlye, for
I had rather dye, than anye liuinge creature should haue mistrust
thereof: and were it not for the loue which I beare vnto your honour,
I&nbsp;had not yet declared the same vnto you, for I do hold my selfe
sufficiente happy and content of the onely loue and affiaunce that you
put in me, crauing nought els butt the continuance of the same.”
Florinda wel satisfyed with this aunswere, began to feele in harte a
further thing to growe than euer she did before: and hearing the honest
reasons alleaged by him, said, that her honestie and vertue shoulde make
aunsweare for her, and therewithall assented to his demaunde: whereof
whether Amadour were ioyful, Louers neede not doubt: but Florinda
credited more his counsell, than he would haue had her. For shee being
fearefull and timerous, not onely before Paulina, but in all other
places, vsed farre other countenaunce than she was wont to do: and in
this alienation of her former familiarity, she misliked the conuersation
that Amadour had with Paulina, whose beauty was such, that she could not
otherwise beleeue, but that hee loued her: and Florinda to passe ouer
her
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page56" id = "page56">56</a></span>
heauinesse, daily vsed the company of Auenturade, that began maruelously
to be ialous betweene her husbande and Paulina, whereof shee made
complaint many times to Florinda, who comforted her so well as shee
coulde, like one attached with the same disease: Amadour coniecturinge
by the countenaunce of Florinda, that not onely shee was estraunged from
hym through his former aduertisement, but also that there was some other
displeasure conceyued, comming vpon a time, from euensong out of the
Monasterie, he sayd vnto her: “Madame, what countenaunce do you make
me?” “Such as I thincke doth please you best,” answered Florinda. Then
Amadour suspecting a matter, to know whether it were true, began to
saye: “Madame, I&nbsp;haue so vsed Paulina, as she beginneth to give
ouer her opinion of you.” She answered him: “Ye cannot do a better thing
either for your selfe or for me: for in doing your selfe a pleasure, you
do honour vnto me.” Amadour iudged by these words that she thought he
toke pleasure to talke of Paulina, wherewith he became so desperate, as
hee could not forbeare to say vnto her in anger: “Madame, you begin very
sone to torment your seruante: there was neuer paine more greeuous vnto
mee, than to be forced to speake to her whom I loue not: and sithens al
that which I do for your seruice is taken in ill part, I&nbsp;wil neuer
speake againe vnto her, whatsoeuer happen: and to dissemble mine anger
and contentacion, I&nbsp;wil addresse my selfe to some place hereby,
till your fancie be ouer past: but I hope I shall receiue newes from my
captaine, to retourne to the warres, where I will so longe continue, as
you shall well knowe, that nothing els but you alone doth force me to
tarrie here.” And in saying so, without attending for her aunswere, hee
incontinently departed, and shee remayned so sad and pensive as any
woman coulde be: and loue began to shewe his greate force in such wyse
as shee knowing her wrong incessantly, wrote to Amadour praying him to
retourne home, which he did within a few dayes after that his choler was
past, and to tell you what businesse there was, to interrupte and breake
the ialousie conceiued, it were superfluous: but in the ende, he wanne
the field, so that she promised him, not onely to beleeue that he loued
not Paulina, but also helde her selfe assured that it should be to him a
martirdome intollerable, to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page57" id = "page57">57</a></span>
speake vnto her or any other, except it were to do her seruice: after
that loue had vanquished this presente suspicion, and that the two
louers began to take more pleasure in their mutuall talke than euer they
did before: newes came that the king of Spaine was about to addres his
Armie to Saulse, wherfore he that was wont to be there with the first,
was not like now to fayle to augment his honour: but true it is, that
his griefe was presently more greate, than at other times before, aswell
for losinge the pleasure which he enioyed, as for feare to finde some
mutacion and chaunge at his returne, because he saw Florinda pursued by
great Princes and Lords, and alreadye come to the age of <span class =
"smallroman">XV.</span> yeares, and thought that if she were maried in
his absence, he should neuer haue occasion to see her againe, except the
Countesse of Arande would appointe his wyfe to waite vppon her: for
accomplishment wherof he made such frends, as the Countesse and Florinda
promised him, that into what soeuer place she were maried his wyfe
Auenturade should attende vpon her: and although it was in question that
Florinda should be maried into Portugall, yet determined that his wyfe
should neuer forsake her: and vppon this assuraunce, not without
vnspeakeable sorow, Amadour departed and left his wife with the
Countesse. When Florinda was alone, her seruaunt departed, shee gaue her
selfe to all vertuous life, hopinge thereby to atteine the fame of a
most perfecte Lady, and to be counted worthie the interteignemente of
such a seruaunt. Amadour arriued at Barsalone, was banqueted and
intertayned of the Ladies after the old maner, but they finding him so
altered and chaunged, thought that Mariage could neuer haue had such
power vppon man, as it had ouer him: for he seemed then to disdaine,
what somtime he greatly desired, and specially the Countesse of
Palamons, whom he derely loued, could deuise by no meanes to make him go
alone home to his lodging: Amadour tarried at Barsalone so little while
as hee coulde, because hee might not come late to the place where hee
purposed to winne and atchiue honour: and being arriued at Saulse, great
and cruell warres were comenced betwene the two kinges, which I purpose
not to recite, ne yet the noble enterprises done by Amadour, whose fame
was bruted aboue the rest of his companions. The duke of Nagyers
arriuinge at Parpignon, had
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page58" id = "page58">58</a></span>
charge of two thousand men, and prayed Amadour to be his Lieuetenaunte,
who with that hand serued so well, as no crie was hard in al the
skirmishes, other than of Nagyers. It chaunced that the king of Thunis,
which of long time had warre with the Spaniards, vnderstandinge howe the
kinges of Spaine and Fraunce were together by the eares at Parpignon and
Narbonne, thought that in better time he could not anoye the king of
Spaine: wherefore he sent a great nomber of Foists and other vessels, to
robbe and spoile those frontiers which were ill guarded and kept: they
of Barsalone seing a nomber of Shippes passe before the Towne,
aduertised the king that was at Saulse, who immediatly sent the Duke of
Nagyers to Palamons: and when the shippes discried that the place was
well guarded, they made as though they would passe further: but about
midnight they retourned, and landed so many men, that the Duke of
Nagyers was taken prisoner. Amadour which was very vigilant, hearing
allarme, presently assembled so many men as he could, and defended him
self so wel, as the force of his enemies a long time could not hurt him:
but in thende knowing that the Duke of Nagyers was taken prisoner, and
that the Turks were determined to burn the Citie of Palamons, and then
to fier the house which he strongly had forced againste them, hee
thought it better to render himself, than to be cause of the losse of so
manye good souldiors as were vnder his gouernmente, and also by putting
himselfe to raunsome, he hoped in time to come to see Florinda: then he
submitted himselfe to a Turke called Derlyn, the gouernor of the king of
Thunis, who conueyed him home to his maister, where he was well
entertaigned, and better kept: for they thought that hauing him in their
hands, they had gotten the only Achilles of Spaine. In this sort Amadour
continued almost the space of two yeares, in the seruice of the king of
Thunis: newes came into Spaine of this ouerthrow, wherof the frends of
the Duke of Nagyers, were very sorowfull: but they that loued the honor
of their countrie, thoughte Amadour to bee the greatest losse, the brute
wherof was noysed in the house of the Countesse of Arande, wher at that
time the poore gentlewoman Auenturade lay very sore sicke. The Countesse
suspecting very much the affection that Amadour
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page59" id = "page59">59</a></span>
bare vnto her daughter, which he suffered and dissembled for his
vertue’s sake, called her daughter aside, and told her the pitious
newes. Florinda which could well dissemble said unto her, that it was a
great losse for al their house, but specially she pitied the state of
his poore wife, because at that time she was so sore sicke. But seing
her mother weepe so bitterly, she let fal some teares to keepe her
company, least through to much dissimulacion her loue might be
discouered. After that time, the Countesse spake to her many times, but
she could neuer perceiue by her countenance, any cause of certaine
suspicion. I&nbsp;will leaue to speake of the voyages, the prayers, the
supplications and fastings, which Florinda did ordinarily make for the
safegard and prosperitie of Amadour, who incontinently so sone as he was
ariued at Thunis, sent newes to his frends, and by a sure messenger
aduertized Florinda, that he was in good health and hope to retourne.
Which newes was to the poore Lady, the only meanes to releue and ease
her sorow. And doubt ye not, but the meanes of writing, was vtterly
debarred from Amadour, wherof Florinda acquited herself so diligently,
as by her letters and epistles, he receiued great consolation and
comfort. The Countesse of Arande receiued commaundement from the king to
repaire to Saragosa, where hee that time was arriued. And there she
found the yong Duke of Cardonne making sute to the king and Queene, for
mariage of her daughter. The Countesse vnwilling to disobey the king,
agreed, thinkinge that her daughter being very yonge, had none other
affection, but that which already had taken sure impression. When the
accorde was concluded, shee sayde vnto her daughter, that she had chosen
that matche, as best worthy to ioyne with her person. Her daughter
considering howe in a thing already done it was to late to take
counsell, said vnto her, that God was to be praised in all things. And
seing her mother so far alienated from her intent, she thought it better
to shew her selfe obedient, than to take pitie vpon herselfe. And to
comfort her in that sorowe, she vnderstode that the infant Fortune was
at the point of death. But before her mother or any other person, she
shewed not so much as one signe or token therof, strayning her grief so
much, as
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page60" id = "page60">60</a></span>
the teares by force retiringe to her harte, did cause the bloud to issue
forth at her Nose, in such abundance, as her life was in present
daunger. And to recouer her of that disease, shee was maried vnto him,
for whose sake shee had rather haue chaunged her life for present death.
After the mariage, Florinda went wyth her husbande into the Duchy of
Cardonne, and in her company Auenturade, to whom she secretly made
complaint, as wel of her mother’s rigor, as also of the sorow she
conceyued for the losse of the sonne of the Infant Fortune. But of her
griefe for Amadour, she spake no worde, but by way of comforting her.
This yong lady then determined to haue God and the respect of her
honoure before her eies, and so wel to dissemble her griefes, as none at
any time should perceiue that shee misliked her husband. In this sort
Florinda passed long time, in a life no lesse pleasaunt than death. The
report whereof she sent to her good seruaunt Amadour, who vnderstanding
her great loue, and wel disposed hart, and the loue shee bare to the
Infant Fortune, thought that it was impossible she could liue long, and
lamented her state more than his owne. This griefe augmented his paine
of imprisonmente, wishinge to haue remayned a slaue all the days of his
life, so that Florinda had had a husbande respondent to her desire,
forgettinge his owne griefe by feeling that his frende did suffer. And
because he vnderstode by a secret friend which he had gotten in the
Court of the king of Thunis, that the king was minded to offer him the
gibbet, or els to make him renounce his fayth, for the desire hee had to
retaine him still, and to make him a good Turke, he behaued himself so
well, wyth him that toke him prisoner, that he gaue him leaue to depart
vpon his fayth, taxing him at so greate raunsome, as he thought a man of
so small substance was neuer able to pay. And so without speaking to the
king his maister, hee let him go vpon his fayth. After he had shewed
himselfe at the Court of the king of Spaine, he departed incontinently
to his frends to get his raunsome, and went straight to Barsalone,
whether the yong Duke of Cardonne, his mother, and Florinda, was gone
aboute certaine affaires. Auenturade so sone as she heard tell that her
husband was come, declared the same
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page61" id = "page61">61</a></span>
to Florinda, who seemed for her sake greatly to reioyce therat. But
fearing that the desire she had to see him would make her chaunge
countenaunce, and that they which knew not the cause therof, would
conceiue some ill opinion, she stode still at a window to see him come a
far of: and so sone as she espied him, shee went downe a paire of darke
staires that none mighte perceiue her chaunge of colour. When she had
imbraced Amadour, shee led him into her chamber, and from thence to her
mother in law, which had neuer seene him before. He had not continued
there two dayes, but he was so well beloued, as he was before in the
house of the Countesse of Arande. I&nbsp;will omitte the words and talke
betwene Florinda and Amadour, and the complaintes which he made vnto her
of his ill aduenture, that hee had sustayned in his absence. And after
manye teares vttered by her, for the heauines she had taken, aswel for
the mariage against her wil, as for the losse of him that she loued so
dearely, and for him whom she thoughte neuer to see againe, shee
determined to take her consolation in the loue and fidelitie that she
bare to Amadour, which notwithstanding she durst not open and declare:
but he that much doubted therof, lost no occasion and time to let her
know and vnderstande the great loue he bare her. And euen vppon the
point that she was ready to receiue him, not as a seruaunt, but for her
assured and perfect frend, there chaunced a maruellous fortune: for the
king, for certaine matters of importance, incontinently sent forth
Amadour, wherof his wyfe conceyued such sorrow, as hearing those newes,
she souned and fell from the stayres where she stode, wherewith she
hurte herselfe so sore, as neuer after she reuiued. Florinda (that by
the death of her had lost all comfort) made such sorrow, as one that was
destitute of good frends and kinsfolke, but Amadour toke the same in
worst part: for he had not onely lost one of the most honest women that
euer was, but also the meanes that he should neuer after that time haue
occasion to visit Florinda. For which cause he fell into such sicknes,
as he was like to haue died sodainly. The old Duchesse of Cardonne,
incessantly did visite him, and alledged many philosophical reasons to
make him paciently to receiue death, <ins class = "correction" title =
"‘t’ missing">bu</ins>
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page62" id = "page62">62</a></span>
it auayled nothing: for if death of thone side did torment him, loue on
the other did augment his martirdome. Amadour seing that his wyfe was
buried, and that the king had sent for him, (hauing no occasion of
longer abode there) he entred into such dispaire, as hee seemed to be
oute of his wittes. Florinda which in comforting him was almost
desolate, remayned by him one whole afternone, vsinge very honest and
discrete talke vnto him, thinking thereby to diminishe the greatnesse of
his sorrowe, and assured him that shee would deuise wayes how he might
visite her more oft than he did thinke for. And because he must depart
the next morning, and was so feeble and weake that he could not rise
from his bed, he intreated her to come and se him at night after euery
man was retired to bed: which she promised to doe, not knowing that
loue’s extremety was voyd of reason. And he that saw no hope euer after
that time to see her againe, whom so long time he had serued: and of
whom he had neuer receyued other interteignment than that you haue
heard, was so beaten and ouercom with loue long dissembled, and of the
despaire he conceiued, that (all meanes to vse her company taken away)
he purposed to play double or quit, either to lose her, or to win her
fauour for euer, and to pay himself at one instant the rewarde which he
thought he had right wel deserued. Wherfore he caused the curtaines of
his bed to be drawen, that they which came into the chamber mighte not
see him, complayning of sicknes more than he was wont to do, wherby they
of the house thought he would not haue liued XXIV. houres. After euery
one of the house had visited him at night, Florinda (at&nbsp;the special
request of her husband) came to see him, thinking for his comfort to
vtter vnto him her affection, and how aboue all other she would loue
him, so far as her honor did permit: and sitting downe in a chayre at
the bed’s head, she began to comfort him, and therwithal powred out many
teares. Amadour seing her sorowful and pensife, thought that in her
great torment he might easely attaine the effect of his intent, and
lifted himself vp in his bed, which Florinda perceyuing, she would haue
staied him, because she thought that through weakenes he was not able to
moue: and kneeling vpon his knees, he said vnto her: “Must
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page63" id = "page63">63</a></span>
I for euermore forgo your sight mine owne deare Lady?” And in saying so
he fel downe betwene her armes like one that fainted for lack of
strength. Then poore Florinda imbraced him, and of long time held him
vp, doing all that was possible for his comfort. But the medecine she
gaue him to ease his sorow, did rather increase the same more strong:
for in fayning himself half dead, without speaking any word, he
attempted that which the honor of womanhode doth defend. When Florinda
perceiued his ill intent, she could scarce beleue the same, considering
his honest requests made before time, and therfore asked him what it was
that he desired. But Amadour fearing to heare her aunswere which he knew
well could be none other but chaste and vertuous, without further talke,
pursued his purpose so earnestly as he could, wherwith Florinda beinge
astonned did suspect he had bin out of his wittes rather than beleue
that he wente about her dishonor. Wherefore with loude voice she called
a gentleman that was in the chamber. Which Amadour hearing, vtterly in
dispaire, threw himself so sodenly into his bed, as the gentleman
thought he had beene dead. Florinda rising out of the chaire, said vnto
him: “Goe quickly and fetch some good vineger.” Which the gentleman did.
Then Florinda began to say vnto him: “Amadour, what follie hath
inchaunted your wisedome? And what is that which you would haue done
unto me?” Amadour that through the force of loue had lost al reason,
said vnto her: “Doth my long seruice merite a recompence of such
cruelty?” “And wher is the honesty then,” said Florinda, “which so many
times you haue preached vnto me?” “Ah, madame!” said Amadour:
“I&nbsp;beleue it is impossible your selfe more faithfully to loue your
owne honour than I do. For when you were vnmaried, I&nbsp;could so wel
subdue my harte and affection, as you did neuer vnderstand my will and
desire. And now that you be maried, to the intente your honour may reste
in couerte, what wrong do I to aske that which is mine owne, for by
force of loue I haue won you? He that first enioyed your harte, hath so
ill followed the victorie of your bodye, as hee hath well deserued to
lose altogether. He that possesseth your body, is not worthy to haue
your hart, wherefore your body is none of his, ne yet he
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page64" id = "page64">64</a></span>
hath no title in the same. But I Madame, these fiue or sixe yeares haue
susteyned suche paynes and trauaile for your sake, as you are not
ignoraunt but to me appertayneth both your body and harte, for whose
sake I haue vtterlye forgotten mine owne. And if you can finde in your
hart to defende mee from my right, doubt ye not but they which haue
proued the forces of loue, wil lay the blame on you, which hath in this
sort robbed me from my libertie, and with your heauenly graces hath
obscured my sences, that not knowing hereafter what to do, I&nbsp;am
constrayned to go without hope for euer to see you againe.
Notwithstanding warrante your selfe, that in what place so euer I am,
you shall still possesse my harte, which shall continue your’s for euer,
be I vppon the lande or water, or betweene the hands of my moste cruell
enemies. But if I could recouer before my departure, that surety of you
which the greatnesse of my loue deserueth, I&nbsp;shall be strong enough
paciently to beare the griefes of my long absence. And if it please you
not to graunt me this request, you shal shortly heare tell that your
rigor hath rendred vnto me a most vnhappy and cruel death.” Florinda no
lesse astonned than sorie, to heare such words proceede from him, of
whom she neuer had any such suspicion, weepinge saide unto him: “Alas,
Amadour, is this the meaning of those vertuous words which sithens the
beginning of my youth ye haue vttered vnto me? Is this the honor of the
conscience, which you haue many times perswaded me rather to die than
lose the same? Haue you forgotten the good examples recited vnto me of
vertuous dames that haue resisted foolish loue? And is this the maner of
your contempt of Ladies that were foolish and vaine, whose light
behauiour you dissembled so much to abhorre? I&nbsp;cannot beleeue
Amadour that you are driuen into such madnes and furie, as the feare of
GOD, your owne conscience, and the estimacion of mine honor, should be
altogether out of your minde and memorie. But if it so be as you say,
I&nbsp;do praise the goodnes of God, which hath preuented the mishap
that nowe I am fallen into, in shewing me by your words, the hart which
I did not know. For hauing lost the sonne of the Infant Fortune, who not
onely is maried into another place, but also loued another, and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page65" id = "page65">65</a></span>
I now maried to him, which I cannot loue, I&nbsp;thought and determined
wholly, with all mine hart and affection to loue you, founding the same
vpon that vertue which I knew to be in you, which loue by your meanes
onelye I haue conceiued, and therfore did more esteeme my honor and
conscience, than the price of mine owne life. Vppon assurance of this
stone of honestie, I&nbsp;am come hither thinking to build a most sure
foundacion. But (Amadour) in one moment thou haste declared, how in
place of a pure foundacion, thy buildinge is reared vpon a light sand,
and vnconstant ground, or els vpon a filthy and foul quamire. And where
I began to erect a good part of the lodgings of this building vpon the
ground of the fidelitie, hoping to dwel there for euer, sodenly thou
hast ouerthrowen the whole plot. Wherfore, you must immediately breake
in sonder the hope and credit that euermore you haue found in me, and
determine that in what place soeuer I be, not to pursue me either by
worde or countenaunce. And do not thinke, that I can or will at anye
time hereafter chaunge this mine opinion, reciting this my last adieu
with great sorrow and griefe. But if I had made an othe of this perfect
amitie and loue, I&nbsp;know mine harte would haue died vpon this
breach, although the astonishment in that I am deceiued, is so great, as
I am wel assured it will make my life either short or sorowfull: and
therefore I bid you farewel and that for euer.” I&nbsp;purpose not to
tel you the sorow which Amadour felt by hearing those words, because it
is impossible not only to write them, but also to thincke them, except
it be of such as haue had experience of the like. And seing that vppon
this cruel conclusion she would haue gone away, he caught her by the
arme, knowing well that if he did not remoue that ill opinion, which by
his owne occasion she had conceyued, hee should lose her for euer.
Wherfore he said vnto her with a very faint chere: “Madame, al the dayes
of my life I haue desired to loue a woman endued with honestie and
vertue: and because I haue found so few, I&nbsp;would fain haue tried
whether your person had bin worthy of estimacion and loue, wherof now I
am wel assured, and humblie do praise God therefore, because mine hart
is addressed to such perfection: beseching you to pardon this fond and
bold
<span class = "pagenum">

attempt, sith you see that the end doth redound to your owne honor and
contentacion.” Florinda, which began to know by him the malice of other
men, like as she was hard to beleue the euill wher it was, euen so she
was more difficile to credite the good where it was not, and said vnto
him: “I&nbsp;pray to God your words be true: yet am I not so ignorant
but that the state of mariage wherein I am, hath made me euidently to
know the strong passion of blind loue which hath forced you vnto this
follie: for if God had losed my hande, I&nbsp;am wel assured you would
not haue plucked back the bridle: they that attempt to seeke after
vertue, do not take the way that you do tread: but this is sufficient if
I haue lightly beleeued any honestie in you, it is time for me now to
know the truth, that I may rid my self from you.” And in saying so,
Florinda went out of the chamber, and all the nighte long, she neuer
left weeping, feeling such great griefe in that alteracion, as her hart
had much to do, to sustaine the assaults of sorrow that loue had made:
for although reason thoughte neuer to loue him againe, yet the hart
which is not subiect to our fancie, would not accord to that crueltie:
for which consideracion, she loued him no lesse than she was wont to do,
and knowing that loue was the cause of that fault, she purposed for
satisfaction of loue, to Loue him with all her hart, and yet for the
obedience and fealtie due to her honor, she thought neuer to make any
semblance. In the morning Amadour departed in this sort, troubled as you
haue hearde, neuerthelesse his couragious heart centred not in dispaire,
but renued a fresh hope once againe to see Florinda, and to win her
fauour: then he toke his iourney towards the Court of Spaine (which was
at Tolledo) taking his way by the Countesse of Arande, wher late in an
euening he arriued, and found the Countesse verye sicke for the absence
of her daughter Florinda: when shee saw Amadour, shee kissed and
imbraced him, as if he had beene her owne child, aswel for the loue she
bare vnto him, as for the like which she doubted that he bare to
Florinda, of whom very earnestly she inquired for newes, who tolde her
the best that he could deuise, but not the whole truth, and confessed
vnto her the loue betweene Florinda and him, (which Florinda had still
conceiled and kept secrete) praying her
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page67" id = "page67">67</a></span>
ayde to bring him againe into her fauour: and so the next morning he
departed. And after he had done his businesse with the Queene, he
repayred to the warres, so sadde and chaunged in all his condicions, as
the Ladies, Captaynes and all they that were wonte to keepe him
companie, did not know him. His apparell was all blacke, mourning for
the death of his wife, wherby he couered the sorrow which was hid in his
hart. In this wyse Amadour passed three or 4 yeres before he returned to
the Court. And the Countesse of Arande which heard tell that Florinda
was so much altered, as it would haue moued any hart to behold her, sent
for her, hoping that she would haue come, but her expectacion was
frustrate, for when Florinda vnderstode that Amadour had told her mother
the good will betweene them, and that her mother being so wise and
vertuous giuing credite to Amadour, did beleue his report, she was in
marueilous perplexitie, because of the one side she saw that her mother
did esteeme him so well, and on the other side if she declared vnto her
the truth, Amadour woulde conceiue displeasure: which thing she had
rather die than to do: wherefore she thought herselfe strong inough to
chastise him of his folly, without helpe of frends. Againe, she
perceyued that by dissembling the euil which she knew by him, she should
be constrained by her mother and her frends, to speake and beare him
good countenaunce, wherby she feared he would be the more encoraged: but
seing that he was far of, she passed the lesse of the matter: and when
the Countesse her mother did commaunde her, she wrote letters vnto him,
but they were such as he might wel gather that they were written rather
vpon obedience, than of good wil, the reading wherof bred sorrow vnto
him in place of that ioye he was wonte to conceiue in her former
wrytings. Within the terme of two or three yeres, after he had done so
many noble enterprises as al the paper of Spaine could not containe
them, he deuised a new inuention, not to wynne and recouer the harte of
Florinda (for he demed the same quite lost) but to haue the victorie
ouer his enemy, sithens she had vsed him in that sorte, and reiecting al
reason and specially feare of death, into the hazarde wherof he hasted
himselfe, he concluded and determined his enterprise in such sorte, as
for his behauiour towardes the Gouernour, hee was
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page68" id = "page68">68</a></span>
deputed and sent by him to treate with the king of certaine exploytes to
be done at Locates, sparing not to impart his message to the Countesse
of Aranda, before he told the same to the king, to vse her good aduise
therein: and so came in poste straight into the Countie of Aranda, where
he had intelligence in what place Florinda remained, and secretly sent
to the Countesse one of his frendes to tell her of his comming, and to
pray her to keepe it close, and that he might speake with her that night
in secrete wise that no man might perceiue: the Countesse very ioyfull
of his comming, tolde it to Florinda, and sent her into her husbande’s
chamber, that she might be ready when she should send for her after eche
man was gone to bed. Florinda whiche was not yet well boldened by reason
of her former feare, making a good face of the matter to her mother,
withdrewe her selfe into an oratorie or chappell, to recommend her selfe
to God, praying him to defend her hart from al wicked affection, and
therwithal considered how often Amadour had praysed her beautie, which
was not impaired or diminished, although she had bene sicke of longe
time before: wherefore thinking it better to doe iniurie to her beautie
by defacing it, than to suffer the harte of so honest a personage by
meanes thereof wickedly to be inflamed, shee tooke vp a stone which was
within the Chappell, and gaue her selfe so great a blowe on the face
that her mouthe, eyes and nose, were altogether deformed: and to
thintent no man might suspect what she had done, when the Countesse sent
for her in going out of the Chappell, she fell downe vppon a great
stone, and therewithall cried out so loude, as the Countesse came in and
founde her in pitious state, who incontinently dressing her face, and
binding it vp with clothes, conueyed her into her chamber, and prayed
her to goe into her closet to entertaigne Amadour, tyll she were weary
of his companie: whiche she did, thinking that there had bene somebody
with hym: but finding him alone, and the doore shut vpon her, Amadour
was not so well pleased as she was discontented: who nowe thoughte
eyther with loue or force to get that, whiche hee had so long tyme
desyred: and after he had spoken a fewe woordes vnto her, and found her
in that mynde hee lefte her, and that to dye for it shee woulde not
chaunge her opinion, desperatly he sayde vnto her: “By God
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page69" id = "page69">69</a></span>
madame, the fruite of my labour shall not be thus taken from me for
scruples and doubtes: and sithe that Loue, pacience, and humble desires,
cannot preuayle, I&nbsp;will not spare by force to get that, which
except I haue it will be the meanes of mine overthrowe.” When Florinda
sawe his face and eyes so altered, and that the fairest die and colour
of the world, was become so red as fier, with his most pleasaunt and
amiable loke transformed into horrible hew and furious, and therewithall
discried the very hote burning fier, to sparkle within his harte and
face: and how in that fury with one of his strong fistes he griped her
delicate and tender hands: and on the other side shee seeing all her
defences to fayle her, and that her feete and handes were caught in
suche captiuitie as she could neither run away nor yet defend her selfe:
knewe none other remedie, but to proue if he had yet remaining in him
any griftes of the former loue, that for the honour therof he might
forget his crueltie. Wherefore she sayd vnto him: “Amadour, if now you
doe accompt me for an enemy, I&nbsp;besech you for the honestie of the
loue which at other times I haue found planted in your harte, to geue me
leaue to speake before you doe torment me.” And when shee saw him
recline his eare, she pursued her talk in this wyse: “Alas, Amadour,
what cause haue you to seke after the thing wherof you shall receiue no
contentation, inflicting vppon me such displeasure as there can be no
greater? you haue many times proued my wil and affection in the time of
my youthfull dayes, and of my beautie farre more excellent than it is
now, at what tyme your passion might better be borne with and excused,
than nowe: in such wyse as I am nowe amased to see that you haue the
harte to torment me at that age and great debilitie wherewith I am
affected: I&nbsp;am assured that you doubt not but that my wyl and mind
is such as it was wont to be: wherefore you can not obtayne your
demaunde but by force: and if you sawe howe my face is arrayed, you
would forget the pleasure whiche once you conceiued in me, and by no
meanes would forcibly approche nere vnto me: and if there be lefte in
you yet any remnantes of loue, it is impossible but that pitie may
vanquishe your furie: and to that pitie and honestie whereof once I had
experience in you, I&nbsp;do make my plaint, and of the same I do
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page70" id = "page70">70</a></span>
demaund grace and pardon, to thintent that according to theffect of your
wonted perswasion and good aduise you may suffer me to liue in that
peace and honestie, which I haue determined and vowed during life: and
if the loue which you haue borne me be conuerted into hatred, and that
more for reuengement than affection, you doe purpose to make me the
moste unhappy of the world, I&nbsp;assure you, you shall not be able to
bryng your intent to passe, besides that you shall constrayne me against
my determination, to vtter and reueale your villany and disordinate
appetite towardes her which did repose in you an incredible affiance: by
discouering whereof, thinke verely that your lyfe cannot continue
without perill.” Amadour breaking her talke sayde vnto her: “If I die
for it, I&nbsp;will presently be acquieted of my torment: but the
deformitie of your face (whiche I thinke was done by you of set purpose)
shall not let me to accomplishe my will: for since I can get nothing of
you but the bones and carcase, I&nbsp;will holde them so fast as I can.”
And when Florinda sawe that prayers, reason, nor teares could not
auayle, but that with crueltie he woulde nedes followe his villanous
desire, which she had hetherto still auoided by force of resistence, she
did helpe her selfe so long, till she feared the losse of her breath,
and with a heauy and piteous voice she called her mother so loud as shee
could crie, who hearing her daughter crie and cal with rufull voyce,
began greatly to feare the thing that was true: wherfore she ran so fast
as she could into the warderobe. Amadour not being so nere death as he
saide he was, left of his holde in suche good time, as the Ladye opening
her closet, founde him at the dore, and Florinda farre enough from him.
The Countesse demaunded of him, saying: “Amadour what is the matter?
tell me the truthe.” Who like one that was neuer vnprouided of excuse,
with his pale face and wanne, and his breath almoste spent, sayde vnto
her: “Alas, madame, in what plight is my lady Florinda? I&nbsp;was neuer
in all my life in that amase wherin I am now: for as I sayd vnto you,
I&nbsp;had thought that I had inioyed part of her good will, but nowe I
know right well that I haue none at all: I&nbsp;thinke madame, that
sithe the time she was brought vp with you, shee was neuer lesse wise
and vertuous than shee is nowe, but farre more daungerous
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page71" id = "page71">71</a></span>
and squeimishe in speaking and talking then behoueth, and euen nowe I
would haue loked vpon her, but she would not suffer me: and when I
viewed her countenaunce, thinking that it had bene some dreame or
vision, I&nbsp;desired to kisse her hande, according to the fashion of
the countrey, which shee vtterly refused. True it is Madame, I&nbsp;haue
offended her, wherof I craue pardon of you, but it chaunced only for
that I toke her by the hand, which I did in a maner by force, and kissed
the same demaunding of her no other pleasure: but she like one
(as&nbsp;I suppose) that hath sworne my death, made an outcry for you
(as&nbsp;you haue hearde) for what cause I know not, except that shee
were afraide I would haue forced some other thing: notwithstanding
Madame, whatsoeuer the matter be, I&nbsp;protest vnto you the wrong is
myne, and albeit that she ought to loue al your honest seruaunts, yet
fortune so willeth as I alone, the moste affectioned of them all, is
clerely exempt out of her fauour: and yet I purpose still to continue
towardes you and her, the same man I came hither, beseching the
continuance of your good grace and fauour, sithens that without desert I
haue loste hers.” The Countesse which partely beleued, and partelye
mistrusted his talke, went vnto her daughter, and demaunded wherfore she
cried out so loud. Florinda answered that she was afrayde: and albeit
the Countesse subtilly asked her of many things, yet Florinda would
neuer make other answere, for that hauing escaped the handes of her
enemy, she thought it punishement enough for him to lose his labour:
after that the Countesse had of long tyme communed with Amadour, she
lefte him yet once againe to enter in talke with Florinda before her, to
see what countenaunce shee would make him. To whom he spake fewe wordes
except they were thankes for that she had not confessed the truthe to
her mother, praying her at least wise that seing he was dispossessed out
of her hart, she would suffer none other to receiue his place: but she
answering his former talke, saide: “If I had had any other meanes to
defend my selfe from you than by crying out, she should neuer haue heard
me, and of me you shall neuer heare worse, except you doe constrayne me
as you haue done, and for louing any other man, you shall not neede to
feare: for sithe I haue not found in your harte (which I estemed the
most
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page72" id = "page72">72</a></span>
vertuous in all the world) the good successe that I desired, I&nbsp;wyll
neuer beleue hereafter that vertue is planted in any man. And this
outrage shall make me free from all passions that Loue can force.” And
in saying so she tooke her leaue. The mother which behelde her
countenaunce, could suspecte nothing, and after that tyme, shee was
persuaded that her daughter bare no more affection to Amadour, and
thought assuredly that she was voyde of reason, because she hated al
those things which she was wont to loue: and from that time forth there
was such warre betwene the mother and the daughter, as the mother for
the space of <span class = "smallroman">VII.</span> yeares would not
speake vnto her, except it were in anger: which she did at the request
of Amadour: during which time, Florinda conuerted the misliking of her
husband, into mere and constant loue, to auoyde the rigour and checkes
of her mother: howbeit, seing that nothing could preuayle, she purposed
to beguile Amadour, and leauing for a day or two her straunge
countenance towards him, she counselled Amadour to loue a woman, whiche
as she sayd, did commonly dispute and talke of their loue. This lady
dwelt with the Queene of Spaine, and was called Lorette, who was very
ioyfull and glad to get such a seruant: and Florinda founde meanes to
cause a brute of this newe loue to be spred in euery place, and
specially the Countesse of Arande (being at the Court) perceiued the
same, who afterwards was not so displeased with Florinda, as she was
wont to be: Florinda vpon a tyme heard tel that a Captain the husband of
Loret, began to be ialous ouer his wife, determining by some meanes or
other, he cared not howe, to kill Amadour. Florinda notwithstanding her
dissembled countenance, could not suffer any hurt to be done to Amadour,
and therefore incontinently gaue him aduertisement thereof: but he
retourning againe to his former follies, answered, that if it would
please her to intertaigne him euery day three houres, he would neuer
speake againe to Lorette, whereunto by no meanes shee would consent.
Then Amadour saide vnto her: “If you will not haue me to liue, wherefore
go ye about to defend me from death? except ye purpose to torment me
aliue with greater extremitie then a thousand deathes can do: but for so
much as death doth flie from me, I&nbsp;will neuer leaue to seeke him
out, by whose
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page73" id = "page73">73</a></span>
approche only I shall haue rest.” Whilest they were in these tearmes,
newes came that the kyng of Granado was about to enter into great warres
against the king of Spain: in suche wyse as the king sent against hym
the Prince his sonne, and with hym the constable of Castile, and the
Duke of Albe, twoo auncient and sage Lordes. The duke of Cardonne and
the counte of Arande not willing to tarie behinde, besought the kyng to
geue eyther of them a charge: whiche hee did according to the dignitie
of their houses, appointing Amadour to be their guide: who during that
warre, did sutche valiaunt factes as they seemed rather to be
desperately than hardily enterprysed: and to come to the effect of this
discourse, his great valiaunce was tryed euen to the death: for the
Moores making a bragge as though they would geue battayle, when they
sawe the army of the Christians, counterfaited a retire, whome the
Spaniardes pursued, but the olde Constable and the duke of Albe doubting
their pollicie, stood still, against the will of the Prince of Spaine,
not suffering him to passe ouer the Ryuer, but the counte of Arande and
the Duke of Cardonne, (although they were countremanded) did followe the
chase, and when the Moores sawe that they were pursued with so small a
number, they returned, and at one recountrie kylled the Duke of
Cardonne, and the Counte of Arande was so sore hurte as hee was lefte
for dead in the place. Amadour arriuing vpon this ouerthrowe, inuaded
the battayle of the Moores with sutche rage and furie, as hee rescued
the twoo bodyes of the Duke and Countie, and caused them to be conueyed
to the Prince’s campe, who so lamented their chaunce, as if they had
bene his owne brethren: but in searching their woundes, the Countie of
Arande was founde to be aliue, and was sent home to his own house in a
horselitter, where of long time he was sicke, and likewise was conueied
to Cardonne the dead bodie of the yong Duke. Amadour in rescuing those
two bodies, tooke so little heede to him selfe, as he was inclosed with
a great number of the Moores, and because he would bee no more taken, as
well to verifie his faith towardes God, as also his vowe made to his
Lady, and also considering that if he were prysoner to the kyng of
Granado, either hee should cruelly be put to death, or els forced to
renounce his faith, he determined not to make his
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page74" id = "page74">74</a></span>
death or taking glorious to his enemies: wherefore kissing the crosse of
his sworde, and rendring his body and soule to the handes of almighty
God, he stabbed him selfe into the body with sutche a blow, as there
neded no second wound to rid him of his life: in this sorte died poore
Amadour, so muche lamented as his vertues did deserue. The newes hereof
was bruted throughout Spaine, and came to Florinda who then was at
Barselone, where her husbande in his life tyme ordeined the place of his
buriall: and after shee had done his honourable obsequies, without
making her own mother, or mother in law priuie, she surrendred her selfe
into the monasterie of Iesus, there to liue a religious life, receiuing
him for her husband and friende, whiche had deliuered her from the
vehement loue of Amadour, and from a displeasaunt life so great and
vnquiet as was the company of her husband. In this wise she conuerted
all her affections, to pietie and the perfit loue of God, who after she
had long time liued a religious life, shee yelded vp her soule in such
ioye as the Bridegrom doth when he goeth to visite his spowes.</p>

The incontinencie of a duke and of his impudencie to attaine his

<p><span class = "firstword">In</span> the Citie of Florence (the
chiefest of all Thuscane) there was a Duke that maried the Lady Margaret
the bastarde daughter of the Emperour Charles the fift. And bicause shee
was very young, it was not lawfull for him to lye with her, but taryng
till she was of riper yeres, he interteigned an vsed her like a noble
gentleman. And who to spare his wife, was amorous of certaine other
Gentlewomen of the citie. Amonges whom he was in loue with a very fayre
and wyse Gentlewoman, that was sister to a Gentleman, a&nbsp;seruaunt of
his, whome the Duke loued so well as himselfe, to whome he gaue so muche
authoritie in his house, as his word was so wel obeied and feared as the
Duke’s him self, and there was no secrete thing in the Duke’s minde, but
he declared the same vnto him, who might ful wel haue bene called a
second himself. The duke seing his sister to be a woman of great
honestie, had no wayes or meanes to vtter vnto her the loue that he bare
her (after he had inuented all occasions possible) at length he came to
this Gentleman which he loued so well, and said vnto him: “My friend, if
there were any thing in all the world, wherein I were able to pleasure
thee, and woulde not doe it at thy request, I&nbsp;should be afraid to
say my fantasie, and much ashamed to craue your help and assistance: but
the loue is such which I bare thee, as if I had a wife, mother, or
daughter, that were able to saue thy life, I&nbsp;would rather imploy
them, than to suffer thee to die in torment: and if thou doe beare vnto
me that affection which am thy maister, thinke verely that I doe beare
vnto thee the like. Wherefore I will disclose vnto thee suche a secrete
and priuie matter, as the silence thereof hath brought me into sutche
plight as thou seest, whereof I doe loke for none amendement but by
death or by the seruice whiche thou maiest doe me, in a certayne matter
which I purpose to tell thee.” The Gentleman hearing the reasons of his
maister, and seing his face not fayned,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page76" id = "page76">76</a></span>
but all besprent with teares, tooke great compassion vpon him and sayd:
“My Lorde, I&nbsp;am your humble seruaunt: all the goodes and worship
that I haue doth come from you. You may saye vnto me as to your moste
approued frende. Assure your self, that all which resteth in my power
and abilitie, is already at your commaundement.” Then the Duke began to
tell him of the loue that hee bare vnto his sister, which was of sutche
force, as if by his meanes he did not enioye her, his life could not
long continue. For he saide, that he knew right well that intreatie and
presentes were with her of no regard. Wherfore he praied him, that if he
loued his life, so well as he did his, to finde meanes for him to
receiue that benefite, which without him he was in despaire neuer to
recouer. The brother which loued his sister and honor of his kindred,
more than the Duke’s pleasure, made a certain reuerence vnto him, humbly
beseeching him to vse his trauaill and pain in all other causes sauing
in that, bicause it was a sute so slaunderous and infamous, as it would
purchase dishonor to his whole familie, adding further, that neither his
hart nor his honor could serue him, to consent to do that seruice. The
Duke inflamed with vnspeakeable furie, put his finger betwene his teeth,
and biting of the nayle, said unto him in great rage: “Well then sithe I
finde in thee no frendship, I&nbsp;know what I haue to doe.” The
Gentleman knowing the crueltie of his Maister, being sore afraide,
replied: “My Lorde, for so much as your desire is vehement and earnest,
I&nbsp;will speake vnto her and brynge you aunswere of her mynde.” And
as he was departing, the Duke sayde vnto him: “See that thou tender my
life as thou wylt that I shall doe thyne.” The Gentleman vnderstanding
well what that woorde did meane, absented him selfe a day or twaine to
aduise what were best to be done. And amonges diuers his cogitations,
there came to his remembraunce the bounden dutie which he dyd owe to his
Maister, and the goodes and honours which he had receyued at his handes,
on the other syde, hee considered the honour of his house, the good life
and chastitie of his syster, who (he&nbsp;knewe well) would neuer
consent to that wickednesse, if by subtiltie shee were not surprised, or
otherwyse forced, and that it were a thing very straunge and rare, that
he should goe about to defame hymselfe and the whole
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page77" id = "page77">77</a></span>
stocke of his progenie. Wherefore hee concluded, that better it were for
hym to die, than to commit a mischief so great vnto his sister, whiche
was one of the honestest women in all Italie. And therewithall
considered how he might deliuer his countrie from sutch a tyrant, which
by force would blemishe and spot the whole race of his auncient stock
and familie. For he knew right wel that except the duke were taken away,
the life of him and his affinitie could not be in securitie and
safegarde: wherfore without motion made to his sister of that matter, he
deuised how to saue his life and the reproche that should follow. Vpon
the second daye he came vnto the duke, and tolde hym in what sorte he
had practised with his sister, and that although the same in the
beginning was harde and difficult, yet in the ende he made her to
consent, vpon condicion that hee would keepe the same so secrete as none
but hymselfe and he myght knowe of it. The duke desirous and glad of
those newes, dyd sone belieue hym, and imbracing the messanger, promised
to geue him whatsoeuer he would demaunde, praying hym with all speede
that hee might inioye his desyred purpose. Whereupon they appointed a
tyme: and to demaunde whether the duke were glad and ioyfull of the
same, it were superfluous. And when the desired night was come, wherin
he hoped to haue the victorie of her whom he thought inuincible, he and
the gentleman alone withdrewe themselues together, not forgetting his
perfumed coif and swete shirte wrought and trimmed after the best maner.
And when eche wight was gone to bed, both they repayred to the appointed
lodging of his Lady, where being arriued they founde a chamber in decent
and comly order. The gentleman taking of the Duke’s night gowne, placed
hym in the bedde, and sayde vnto hym: “My Lorde, I&nbsp;wil nowe goe
seeke her, which can not enter into this chamber without blushing,
howbeit I truste before to morrowe morning she wyll be very glad of
you.” Which done, he left the Duke, and went into his own chamber, where
he founde one of his seruantes alone, to whome he sayde: “Hast thou the
harte to followe me into a place where I shall be reuenged vpon the
greatest enemie that I haue in the worlde?” “Yea sir,” aunswered his
man. Whereupon the Gentleman toke him with him so sodainly, as he had no
leasure to arme him
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page78" id = "page78">78</a></span>
selfe with other weapon but with his onely dagger. And when the Duke
heard him come againe, thinking he had brought her with hym that he
loued so derely, hee drewe the curteine, and opened his eyes to behold
and receiue that ioye which he had so long loked for, but in place of
seeing her which he hoped should be the conseruation of his life, he
sawe the acceleration of his death, which was a naked sworde that the
Gentleman had drawen, who therwithall did strike the Duke, which was in
his shirte voyde of weapon, although well armed with courage, and
sitting vp in his bedde grasped the Gentleman about the body, and sayde:
“Is this thy promise whiche thou hast kept?” And seeing that he had no
other weapon but his teeth and nayles, he bitte the gentleman in the
arme, and by force of his owne strengthe he so defended himselfe, as
they bothe fell downe into the flower. The gentleman fearing the match,
called for hys manne, who finding the Duke and his maister fast
together, that he wyst not whether to take, he drewe them both by the
feete into the middest of the chamber, and with his dagger assayde to
cut the Duke’s throte. The duke who defended himselfe, till suche time
as the losse of his bloud made him so weake and feeble that he was not
able to contende any longer. Then the Gentleman and his man laide him
againe into his bed, where they accomplished the effect of that murther.
Afterwardes drawing the curteine, they departed and locked the dead body
in the chamber. And when he saw that he had gotten the vicctorie of his
enemy, by whose death he thought to set at libertie the common wealth,
he supposed his facte to be vnperfect if he did not the like to fiue or
sixe of them which were nerest to the Duke, and best beloued of him. And
to attaine the perfection of that enterpryse, he bad his man to doe the
like vnto them one after another, that hee had done to the Duke. But the
seruaunt being nothing hardie or coragious, said vnto his maister: “Me
thinke, sir, that for this time ye haue done enough, and that it were
better for you now to deuise waye howe to saue your owne life, than to
seeke meanes to murder any more. For if we do consume so long space of
time to kill euery of them, as we haue done in murdering of the Duke,
the day light will discouer our enterprise before we haue made an ende,
yea although wee finde them naked and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page79" id = "page79">79</a></span>
without defence.” The gentleman whose euill conscience made him
fearfull, did beleue his seruaunt, and taking him alone with him, went
to the bishop that had in charge the gates of the citie, and the vse of
the Postes, to whom he sayd: “This euening (my&nbsp;Lord) newes came
vnto me that mine owne brother lieth at the point of death, and crauing
licence of the Duke to goe se him he hath giuen me leaue. Wherefore I
beseche you commaunde the Postes to deliuer me two good horse, and that
you will sende worde to the porter that the gates may be opened.” The
bishop which estemed no lesse his request than the commaundement of the
Duke his maister, incontinently gaue him a billet, by vertue wherof both
the gates were opened, and the horse made ready according to his
demaunde. And vnder colour and pretence of visiting his brother, he rode
to Venice, where after he had cured himselfe of the duke’s bitinges
fastened in his fleshe, he trauailed into Turkey. In the morning the
duke’s seruauntes seing the time so late before their maister retourned,
suspected that he was gone forth in visiting of some Ladye, but when
they sawe he taried so long, they began to seke for him in euery place.
The poore Duchesse into whose harte the loue of her husbande strongly
did inuade, vnderstanding that he could not be founde, was very pensife
and sorowfull. But when the Gentleman which he so dearely loued, was not
likewyse seene abroade, searche was made in his chamber, where finding
bloud at the chamber dore, they entred in, but no man was there to tell
them any newes, and following the tract of the bloud the poore seruantes
of the Duke went to the chamber dore, where he was, which dore they
found fast locked, who incontinently brake open the same: and seing the
place all bloudy, drew the curteine, and found the wretched carcasse of
the Duke lying in the bedde, sleeping his endlesse sleepe. The sorrow
and lamentation made by the duke’s seruauntes, carying the dead bodye
into his palace, is easie to be coniectured. Wherof when the Bishop was
aduertised, he repaired thether, and tolde how the Gentleman was gone
awaye in the night in great haste, vnder pretence to goe to see his
brother: whereupon it was euidently knowen that it was he that had
committed the murder. And it was proued that his poore sister was neuer
priuie to the facte, who although she was astonned with the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page80" id = "page80">80</a></span>
sodaynes of the deede, yet her loue towardes her brother was farre more
increased, bicause he had deliuered her from a Prince so cruell, the
enemy of her honestie: for doing whereof he did not sticke to hazard his
owne life. Whereupon she perseuered more and more in vertue, and
although she was poore, by reason her house was confiscate, yet both her
sister and shee matched with so honest and riche husbandes as were to be
founde in Italie: and afterwardes they both liued in good and great
reputation.</p>

One of the Frenche kinge’s called Frauncis the firste of that name,
declared his gentle nature to Counte Guillaume, that would haue killed
him.</p>


<p><span class = "firstword">In</span> Digeon a town of Burgundie, there
came to the seruice of king Frauncis, (whiche was father to Henry the
second of that name, whiche Henry was kylled by Mounsier Mongomerie, in
a triumphe at the Tilt, and graundfather to Charles the <span class =
"smallroman">IX.</span> that now raigneth in Fraunce) an Earle of
Allemaigne called Guillaume, of the house of Saxon, whereunto the house
of Sauoie is so greatly allied, as in old time they were but one. This
Counte for so much as he was estemed to be so comely and hardy a
Gentleman as any was in Almaigne, was in sutche good fauour with the
king, as he tooke him not onely into seruice, but vsed him so nere his
persone, as he made him of his priuy chamber. Vpon a day the Gouernour
of Burgundie, the Lorde Trimouille (an&nbsp;auncient knight and loyall
seruaunt of the kyng) like one suspicious and fearfull of the euill and
hurte of his Maister, had daylie espies ouer his enemies, vsing his
affaires so wysely, as very fewe thinges were concealed from hym. Among
other aduertisementes, one of his friendes wrote vnto him that the
Counte Guillaume had receiued certain sommes of money, with promise of
more, if by any meanes he could deuise which waye to kill the king. The
Lorde of Trimouile hearing of this, failed not to come to the kyng to
giue him knowledge thereof, and disclosed it lykewyse to Madame Loyse of
Sauoye his mother, who forgetting her amitie and aliaunce with the
Almaigne Earle, besought the king forthwith to put hym awaye. The kyng
prayed his mother to speake no more thereof, and sayde, that it was
impossible that so honest a Gentleman would attempt to doe a deede so
wicked. Within a while after, there came other newes of that matter,
confirming the first: whereof the Gouernour for the intire loue he bare
to his Maister, craued licence either to expel him the countrie, or to
put him in warde. But the king gaue speciall
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page82" id = "page82">82</a></span>
commaundement that he should not make any semblaunce of displeasure, for
that hee purposed by some other meanes to knowe the truthe. Vpon a time
when he went a hunting he girded about him the best sworde that hee had,
to serue for all armes and assayes, and toke with him the Counte
Guillaume, whome he commaunded to wayte vpon him, the firste and
chiefest next his owne persone. And after he had followed the hart a
certayne tyme, the kyng seing that his traynes was farre from hym, and
no man neare him sauing the Counte, tourned hym selfe rounde about, and
when hee sawe that hee was alone, in the mydde of the forest, hee drew
out his sworde, and sayd to the Counte: “How saye you, (sir counte) is
not this a fayre and good swoorde?” The counte feling it at the point,
and well viewyng the same, aunswered that he neuer sawe a better in all
his life. “You haue reason,” sayde the kyng, “and I beleue that if a
Gentleman were determined to kyll mee, and did knowe the force of myne
armes, and the goodnesse of myne harte accompanied with this sword, he
would bee twyse well aduised before hee attempted that enterprise.
Notwithstanding I would accompt him but a cowarde, wee being alone
withoute witnesses, if he did not attempt that, which he were disposed
to do.” The Counte Guillaume with bashfull and astonned countenaunce
aunsweared: “Sir, the wickednesse of the enterprise were very great, but
the folly in the execution were no lesse.” The king with those wordes
fell in a laughter, and put the sword in the skaberd againe: and hearing
that the chase drewe neare him, he made to the same so faste as he
coulde. When he was come thether, he said nothing of that which had
passed betweene theim, and verelye thoughte that the Counte Guillaume
although that he was a stronge and stoute gentleman, yet he was no man
to do so great an enterprise. But the Counte Guillaume, fearing to be
bewrayed or suspected of the fact, next day morning repayred to Robertet
the Secretarie of the kinge’s reuenues, and saide that hee had well
wayed the giftes and annuities which the kinge would giue him to tarrie,
but he perceiued that they were not sufficient to interteigne him for
halfe a yeare, and that if it pleased not the king to double the same,
hee should be forced to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page83" id = "page83">83</a></span>
departe, praying the sayde Robertet to know his grace’s pleasure so sone
as he coulde, who sayd vnto him, that he himselfe could without further
commission disbursse no more vnto him, but gladly without further delay
he would repaire to the king: which he did more willingly, because he
had seene the aduertisements of the Gouernor aforesaid. And so sone as
the kinge was awake, he declared the matter vnto him in the presence of
Monsier Trimouille and Monsier Bouinet, lord admirall, who were vtterly
ignorant of that which the king had done. To whom the kinge said: “Loe,
ye haue bene miscontented for that I would not put away the Counte
Guillaume, but now ye see he putteth away himselfe. Wherefore Robertet
(quoth the king) tell him, that if he be not content with the state
which he receiued at his first entrie into my seruice, whereof many
gentlemen of good houses would thinke themselues happie, it is meete
that he seeke his better fortune, and tell him that I would be lothe to
hinder him, but wilbe very well contented, that he seeke where he may
liue better, accordingly as he deserueth.” Robertet was so diligent to
beare this aunsweare to the Counte, as he was to present his sute to the
kinge. The counte said that with his licence he would gladly go
forthwith: and as one whom feare forced to depart, he was not able to
beare his abode 24 houres. And as the king was sitting downe to dinner,
fayning to be sorye for his departure, but that necessitie compelled him
to lose his presence, hee toke his leaue. He went likewise to take leaue
of the king’s mother, which she gaue him with so great ioy, as she did
receiue him, being her nere kinsman and freind. Then he went into his
countrie: and the king seing his mother and seruantes astonned at his
sodaine departure, declared vnto them the Al Arme, which he had giuen
him, saying, that although he was innocent of the matter suspected, soe
was his feare greate ynoughe, to departe from a maister wyth whose
condicions hitherto he was not acquainted.</p>

<p class = "summary">
A pleasaunt discours of a great Lord to enioy a Gentlewoman of
Pampelunæ.</p>


<p><span class = "firstword">There</span> was in the time of king Lewes
the <span class = "smallroman">XII.</span> of that name, a&nbsp;young
Lord, called the lorde of Auannes sonne to the Lorde Alebret, and
brother to king John of Nauarre, with whom the said Lord of Auannes
ordinarely remayned. Now this yong Lorde was of the age of <span class =
"smallroman">XV.</span> yeares, so comely a personage, and full of
curtesie and good behauiour, as he seemed to be created for none other
purpose, but to be beloued and regarded: and so he was in deede of al
those that did wel behold and note his commendable grace and condicion,
but chiefly of a woman, dwelling in the citie of Pampelunæ in Nauarre,
the wife of a rich man, with whom she liued honestly: and although she
was but 23 yeres of age, and her husband very nere fiftie, yet her
behauior was so modest, as she seemed rather a widow than a maried wyfe,
who vsed not to frequent and haunte any mariages, banquets, or common
assemblies without the company of her husbande, the vertue and goodnes
of whom she so greatly esteemed, as she preferred the same before the
beautie of al others. The husband, hauing experience of her wisedome,
put such trust in her, as he committed al thaffaires of his house to her
discretion: vpon a day this rich man with his wife, were inuited to a
mariage of one that was nere kinne vnto him: to which place (for the
greater honor of the mariage) repaired the yong Lord of Auannes, who
naturally was giuen to dauncing, and for his excellencie in dauncing
there was not his like to be found in his time: after dinner when they
prepared to daunce, the Lord of Auannes was intreated thereunto by the
rich man: the said lord asked him with what gentlewoman hee should lead
the daunce. He aunsweared him: “My Lord if there were any one more
beautifull, or more at my commaundement then my wyfe, I&nbsp;would
present her vnto you, beseeching you to do mee so much honour as to take
her by the hande.” Which the yong Lorde did, and by reason of his
youthfull courage he toke more
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page85" id = "page85">85</a></span>
pleasure in vaultinge and dauncinge, then in beholding the beautie of
the Ladies: and she whom he ledde by the hand, contrarywyse regarded
more the grace and beautie of the said yong Lord, then the daunce wherin
she was, albeit for her great wisedome she made therof no semblance at
al. When supper time was come, the Lord of Auannes badde the companie
farewell and went home to the castle: whether the riche man accompanied
him vppon his moile: and riding homewards together, hee saide vnto him:
“My Lord, this day you haue done so great honor vnto my kinsemen and
mee, that it were great ingratitude is I should not offer my selfe with
all the goods I haue to do you seruice: I&nbsp;knowe sir that such
Lordes as you be which haue nere and couetous fathers, many times do
lacke money which we by keeping of smal houshold, and vsing good
husbandrie do heape and gather together. Now thus it is sir, that God
hauing giuen mee a wife accordinge to my desire he would not in this
world altogether indue mee with heauenly pleasures, but hath left me
voyde of one ioy which is the ioye that fathers haue of children.
I&nbsp;know sir that it is not my dutie, and belongeth not to my state
to adopt you for such a one, but if it maye please you to receiue mee
for your seruaunt, and to declare vnto me your small affaires, so farre
as a hundred thousande Crownes shall extende, I&nbsp;will not sticke to
helpe your necessities.” The yong Lorde of Auannes was very ioyfull of
this offer, for he had suche a father as the other had described vnto
him: and after he had giuen him hartie thanckes, he called him his
friendlye father. From that time forth the sayd riche man conceiued such
loue in the yong Lord, as daily he ceased not to inquire of his lacke
and want, and hid not from his wyfe the deuocion which he bare to the
said Lorde of Auannes, for which she rendred vnto him double thanckes.
And after that time the said yong Lord lacked not what he desired, and
many times resorted to that rich man’s to drincke and eate with him, and
finding him not at home, his wyfe rewarded him with his demaunde: whoe
admonished her by wyse and discrete talke to be vertuous, because he
feared and loued her aboue all the women of the worlde. She which had
God and her honor before her eyes, was contente with his sight and
talke, wherin consisted the satisfaction of his honestie and vertuous
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page86" id = "page86">86</a></span>
loue: in such wise as she neuer made any signe or semblaunce, wherby he
might thinke and iudge that shee had anye affection vnto him, but that
which was both brotherlie and christian. During this couerte amitie, the
Lord of Auannes through the foresaid ayde, was very gorgious and trimme,
and approching the age of <span class = "smallroman">XVII.</span>
yeares, began to frequent the company of Gentlewomen more then he was
wont to do: and although he had a more willing desire, to loue that wyse
and discrete dame aboue other, yet the feare which he had to lose her
loue (if&nbsp;shee misliked her sute) made him to hold his peace, and to
seeke els wher: and gaue himself to the loue of a Gentlewoman dwelling
hard by Pampelunæ, which had to husband a yong gentleman, that aboue all
thinges loued and delighted in dogges, horsse, and Hawkes. This noble
Gentleman began (for her sake) to deuise a thousand pastimes, as
Torneyes, running at the Tilt, Mommeries, Maskes, feastes and other
games, at all which this yong dame was present: but because that her
husband was very fantasticall, and saw his wyfe to be faire and wanton,
hee was ialous of her honour, and kepte her in so straite, as the sayde
Lord of Auannes colde get nothing at her hands but words, shortly
spoken, in some daunce, albeit in litle time and lesse speache, the
sayde Lorde perceyued that there wanted nothing for full perfection of
their loue, but time and place: wherfore he came to his new adopted
father the rich man, and said vnto him that he was minded with great
deuocion to visite our Lady of Montferrat, intreating him to suffer his
houshoulde traine to remaine with him, because he was disposed to go
thither alone. Whereunto he willingly agreed: but his wyfe whose hart
the great prophet loue had inspired, incontinently suspected the true
cause of that voyage, and cold not forbeare to saye vnto the Lord of
Auannes these woords: “My Lord, my Lorde, the pilgrimage of the Lady
whom you worshippe, is not farre without the walles of the Citie,
wherefore I beseech you aboue all thinges to haue regarde vnto your
health.” Hee which feared her, and loued her, blushed at her words, and
without talke by his countenaunce he seemde to confesse the trothe:
whereupon he departed, and when he had bought a couple of faire Genets
of Spaine he clothed himself like a horsekeeper and so disguised
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page87" id = "page87">87</a></span>
his face as no man knew him. The Gentleman which had maried that fonde
and wanton gentlewoman, louinge aboue all thinges (as&nbsp;is sayde
before) fayre horses, espyed those two Genets which the lord of Auannes
did lead, and incontinently came to buy them: and after he had bought
them, hee beheld the horse-keeper which rode and handled them passing
well, and asked him if he were willing to serue him: the Lord of Auannes
answeared yea, and added further how he was a poore horse-keeper
vnskilfull of other science but of keepinge of horse, which practize hee
could do so well, as he doubted not but he should content and please
him: the Gentleman very glad thereof, gaue him charge of all his horse,
and called forth his wyfe vnto him, vnto whom he recommended his horse
and horsekeper, and told her that he himself was disposed to go to the
castel: the gentlewoman so well to please her husband as for her owne
delight and pastime, wente to loke vpon her horse and to behold her new
horskeper, who seemed to be a man of good bringing vp, notwithstanding
she knewe him not. He seing that she had no knowledge of him, came to do
reuerence vnto her after the maner of Spaine, and taking her by the hand
kissed the same, and by kissing of her hand, he disclosed himself so
much as she knew him: for in dauncing with her many times he vsed the
like curtesie: and then she ceased not to deuise place wher she might
speake to him a part: which she did the very same euening: for being
bidden to a feast wherunto her husband would faine haue had her to go,
she fayned herselfe to be sicke and not able: and her husband loth to
faile his frends request, said vnto her: “For so much (my&nbsp;good
wyfe) as you be not disposed to go with me, I&nbsp;pray you to haue
regard to my dogges and horse that they may lack nothing.” The
Gentlewoman was very wel contented with that comission: howbeit without
chaung of countenance she made him answere that sith in better things he
would not imploie her, she would not refuse the least, to satisfie his
desire: and her husband was no soner out of the gates, but she went down
into the stable, where she founde faulte wyth diuers things: for
prouision whereof she committed such seueral busines to her men on euery
side, that shee remayned alone with the master horskeper: and for feare
least any should
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page88" id = "page88">88</a></span>
come vpon them vnwares, she said vnto him: “Go into my garden and tarie
my comming in the litle house at the ende of the alley.” Which he did so
diligently as hee had no leasure to thancke her, and after that she had
giuen order to the yeomen of the stable, shee went to see the dogges,
counterfaiting like care and diligence to haue them wel intreated: in
such wise as she seemed rather a mayde of the chamber then a maistresse
of the house: which done shee returned into her chamber, where she made
her self to be so werie, as she went to bed, saying that she was
disposed to sleepe. All her women left her alone except one in whom she
reposed her greatest trust, and vnto whom she said: “Go downe into the
garden, and cause him whom you shall finde at the end of the alley, to
come hither.” The mayde wente downe and founde the Maister horskeeper
there, whom forthwith shee brought vnto her maistresse: and then the
gentlewoman caused her mayd to go forth to watch when her husbande came
home. The lord of Auannes seing that he was alone with his maistres, put
of his horsekeeper’s apparrel, plucked from his face his false nose and
beard, and not as a feareful horsekeeper, but like such a Lord as he
was, without asking leaue of the Gentlewoman, boldly laied him downe
beside her: where hee was of that foolishe woman receiued so ioyfully,
as his estate and goodly personage did require, continuing with her
vntil the retorne of her husband: at whose comming putting vpon him
againe his counterfaite attire, left the pleasure which by policie and
malice he had vsurped. The gentleman when hee was within, hearde tell of
the dilligence which his wife had vsed vppon his commaundemente, and
thanked her very hartelie. “Husband (said the gentlewoman) I&nbsp;do but
my dutie, and do assure you that if there be no ouerseer to checke and
commaunde your negligent seruaunts, you shal haue neyther dogge nor
horse well kept and ordred: forasmuche as I knowe their slouth, and your
good wil, you shalbe better serued then you haue bin heretofore.” The
gentleman who thought that he had gotten the best horsekeeper of the
worlde, asked her how she liked him. “I&nbsp;assure you sir (quoth she)
he doth his busines so well as any seruaunt, howbeit he had neede to be
called vppon, for you know seruaunts in these dayes without an ouerseer,
wilbe be slow and carelesse.” Thus of
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page89" id = "page89">89</a></span>
long time continued the husbande and wyfe in greater amitie and loue
then before, and gaue ouer all the suspicion and ialousie which hee had
conceyued, because before time his wyfe louinge feastes, daunces and
companies, was become intentife and diligente about her household: and
perceiued that now many times she was contented in homely garmentes to
go vp and downe the house wher before she was accustomed to be 4 houres
in trimming of herselfe: whereof shee was commended of her husbande, and
of euery man that knew not how the greater deuill had chased awaye the
lesse. Thus liued this yonge dame vnder the hypocrisie and habite of an
honest woman, in suche fleshlye pleasure as reason, conscience, order
and measure, had no longer resting place in her: which insaciat lust the
yong Lord of delicate complexion was no longer able to susteine, but
began to waxe so pale and feeble, as he needed no visarde for
disfiguring of himselfe. Notwithstanding the folish loue which he bare
to that woman so dulled his sence, as he presumed vppon that force which
fayled in the monstruous giant Hercules, whereby in the ende constrayned
with sicknes and councelled by his maistresse, which loued not the sicke
so well as the hole, demaunded leaue of his maister to go home to his
frends: who to his great griefe graunted him the same: and caused him to
make promise that when he was recouered hee should returne againe to his
seruice. Thus went the Lord of Auannes on foote away from his maister,
for he had not paste the lenght of one streate to trauaile. And when he
was come to the rich man’s house his new father, he found none at home
but his wyfe, whose vertuous loue shee bare him was nothing diminished
for al his voyage: but when she saw him so leane and pale, she could not
forbeare to say vnto him: “Sir, I&nbsp;knowe not in what staye your
conscience is, but your body is litle amended by this pilgrimage, and I
am in doubte that the way wherein you traueiled in the night, did wearie
and paine you more, then that vppon the daye: for if you had gone to
Hierusalem on foote, you mighte perhappes haue returned more Sunne
burned, but more leane and weake it had bin impossible. Now make accompt
of your pilgrimage here, and serue no more such Sainctes, for in place
of raysinge the deade from life, they do to death those that
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page90" id = "page90">90</a></span>
be on liue: moreouer I shall saye vnto you, that if your bodye were
neuer so sinfull, I&nbsp;see well it hath suffred such penaunce, as I
haue pitie to renewe anye former payne.” When the Lorde of Auannes had
hearde all her talke he was no lesse angrie with himselfe then ashamed,
and saide vnto her: “Madame, I&nbsp;haue sometimes heard tell that
repentaunce insueth sinne, and now I haue proued the same to my cost,
praying you to excuse my youth that could not be corrected but by
experience of that euill, which before it would not beleeue.” The
Gentlewoman chaunging her talke, caused him to lye downe vppon a fayre
bedde, where he lay the space of <span class = "smallroman">XV.</span>
dayes, feedinge onely vppon restoratiues: and the husband and wyfe kept
him so good companye, as one of theim neuer departed from him: and
albeit that he had committed those follies, (suche as you haue heard)
against the minde and aduise of that wyse and discrete dame, yet shee
neuer diminished the vertuous loue which shee bare him, for shee still
hoped that after he had spent his yonger dayes in youthly follies, he
would retire at length when age and experience should force him to vse
honest loue, and by that meanes would be altogether her owne. And during
those fifteene dayes that he was cherished in her house, she vsed vnto
him womanly and commendable talke, onely tending to the loue of vertue,
which caryed such effect as he began to abhorre the follie that he
committed: and beholding the gentlewoman which in beautie passed the
other wanton, with whom he had delt before, he imprinted in minde more
and more the graces and vertues that were in her, and was not able to
keepe in harte the secrete conceipt of the same, but abandoning all
feare, he sayd vnto her: “Madame, I&nbsp;see no better means, to be such
one, and so vertuous as you by wordes desire me for to be, but to settle
my harte, and giue my selfe to be holie in loue with vertue, and the
qualities therunto appertinent. I&nbsp;humblie beseech you therfore
(good madame) to tel me if your selfe wil not vouchsafe to giue me al
your ayde and fauor that you possiblie can, for thobteyning of the
same.” The maistresse very ioyful to heare him vse that language, made
him aunswere: “And I do promise you sir, that if you wilbe in loue with
vertue as it behoueth so noble a state as you be, I&nbsp;wil do you the
seruice that I can to bring you thereunto
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page91" id = "page91">91</a></span>
with such power and abilitie as God hath planted in mee.” “Well madame,”
saide the Lorde of Auannes, “remember then your promise, and vnderstande
that God vnknowen of the Christian but by fayth, hath dayned to take
flesh, like to that our sinful which we beare about vs, to thend that by
drawing our flesh into the loue of his humanity, he may draw also our
minde to the loue of his diuinitie, and requireth to be serued by
thinges visible to make vs loue by fayth that diuinity which is
inuisible: in like maner the vertue which I desire to imbrace all the
dayes of my life, is a thing inuisible and not to be seen but by outward
effects. Wherfore needeful it is, that she now do put vpon her some body
or shape to let herselfe be knowen amonges men: which in deede she hath
don by induing herself with your form and shape, as the most perfect
that she is able to find amonges liuing creatures. Wherfore I do
acknowledge and confesse you to be not onely a vertuous creature, but
euen very vertue it self. And I which see the same to shine vnder the
glimsing vaile of the most perfect that euer was: I&nbsp;will honor and
serue the same during my life, forsaking (for the same) all other vaine
and vicious loue.” The gentlewoman no lesse content then marueling to
here those words dissembled so wel her contented minde as she said vnto
him: “My Lord, I&nbsp;take not vpon me to aunswere your diuinity, but
like her that is more fearefull of euill then beleful of good, do
humblie beseech you to cease to speake to me those words of prayse, that
is not worthy of the least of them. I&nbsp;know right wel that I am a
woman, not onely as another is, but so imperfect, as vertue might do a
better acte to transforme me into her, then she to take my forme, except
it be when she desires to be vnknowen to the world: for vnder such
habite as mine is, vertue cannot be knowen, according to her worthines:
so it is sir, that for mine imperfection, I&nbsp;wil not cease to bere
you such affection, as a woman ought or maye do that feareth God, and
hath respect to her honour: but that affection shal not appere, vntill
your harte be able to receiue the pacience which vertuous loue
commaundeth. And now sir I know what kinde of speach to vse, and thincke
that you do not loue so well, your owne goodes, purse or honour, as I
doe with all my hart tender and imbrace the same.” The
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page92" id = "page92">92</a></span>
lord of Auannes fearefull with teares in eyes, besought her earnestly
that for her woordes assuraunce, shee woulde vouchsafe to kisse him:
which she refused, saying that for him, she would not breake the
countrie’s custome: and vppon this debate the husband came in, to whom
the Lord of Auannes said: “My father, I&nbsp;knowe my selfe so much
bounde to you and to your wife, as I besech you for euer to repute me
for your sonne.” Which the good man willingly did. “And for surety of
that amitie, I&nbsp;pray you,” said Monsier D’Auannes, “that I may kisse
you.” Whiche he did. After he said vnto him: “If it were not for feare
to offend the Law, I&nbsp;would do the like to my mother your wyfe.” The
husbande hearinge him saye so, commaunded his wyfe to kisse him, which
she did although she made it straunge, either for the Lord’s desire or
for husband’s request to do the same: then the fier (which words had
begunne to kindle in the harte of the poore Lorde) beganne to augmente
by that desired kisse, so strongly sued for, and so cruelly refused:
which done the sayde Lord of Auannes repayred to the Castell to the
kinge his brother, where he told many goodly tales of his voyage to
Montferrat, and vnderstode there, that the kinge his brother was
determined to remoue to Olly and Taffares, and thinking that the iorney
woulde be longe, conceiued great heauines, which made him to muse how he
mighte assaye before his departure, whether the wise Gentlewoman bare
him such good will, as shee made him beleeue shee did: and therefore hee
toke a house in the streate where she dwelt, which was old and ill
fauoured and built of Timber: which house about midnight of purpose he
set on fier, wherof the crye was so great throughout the Citie as it was
hard within the rich man’s house. Who demaunding at his window wher the
fier was, vnderstode it to be at the Lord of Auannes, wherunto he
incontinentlye repayred with all the people of his house, and found the
yonge Lord in his shirt in the middest of the streat, whom for pitie he
toke betweene his armes, and couering him with his nighte Gowne, caried
him home to his house with al possible speede, and saide vnto his wife
which was a bed: “Wife, I&nbsp;giue you to kepe this prisoner, vse him
as my selfe.” So sone as he was departed the sayd Lord of Auannes, who
had good wil to be
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page93" id = "page93">93</a></span>
interteigned for her husband, quicklie lept into the bed, hoping that
the occasion and place would make that wise woman to chaunge her minde,
which he founde to be contrary: for so sone as he lept into the bed of
thone side, shee speedelie went out of the other, and putting on her
night Gowne she repaired to the bed’s head, and said vnto him: “How now
sir, do you thincke that occasions can chaunge a chaste harte? beleeue
and thincke that as gold is proued in the Fornace, euen so an vnspotted
hart in the middest of temptacion: wherein many times an honest hart
sheweth it selfe to be more strong and vertuous, then els where, and the
more it is assailed by his contrary, the coulder be the desires of the
same: wherefore be you assured that if I had bin affected with other
minde then that which many times I haue disclosed vnto you, I&nbsp;would
not haue fayled to finde meanes to haue satisfyed the same: praying you
that if you will haue me to continue the affection which I beare you, to
remoue from your minde for euer not onely the will but the thoughte
also, for any thinge you be able to doe to make me other then I am.” As
she was speaking of these words her women came into the chamber, whom
she commaunded to bring in a colacion of all sortes of comficts and
other delicats: but that time hee had no appetite either to eate or
drincke, hee was fallen into suche dispaire for fayling of his
enterprise: fearing that the demonstracion of his desire, would haue
caused her to giue ouer the secrete familiaritie betweene them. The
husbande hauinge ceased the fier, retorned and intreated the Lord of
Auannes that night to lodge in his house, who passed that night in such
nomber of cogitacions as his eyes were more exercised with weeping then
sleeping, and early in the morninge he bad them farewell in their bedde,
where by kissing the Gentlewoman hee well perceiued that she had more
pitie upon his offence, then euill will against his person, which was a
cole to make the fier of loue to kindle more fiercely. After dinner he
rode with the king of Taffares, but before his departure he went to take
his leaue of his newe alied father and of his wyfe: whoe after the furst
commaundement of her husband, made no more difficultie to kisse him then
if he had bin her owne sonne. But be assured the more that vertue stayed
her
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page94" id = "page94">94</a></span>
eye and countenaunce to shew the hidden flame, the more it did augment
and become intollerable, in such wyse as not able to indure the warres
which honour and loue had raysed within her hart, (who notwithstanding
was determined neuer to shewe it, hauing lost the consolacion of her
sight, and forgeuen the talke with him for whom she liued)
a&nbsp;continuall feuer began to take her, caused by a Melancholicke and
couert humor, in such wyse as the extreme partes of her body waxed cold,
and those within burnt incessantly. The Phisitions (in&nbsp;the hands of
whom man’s life doth not depend) began greatly to mistrust health by
reason of a certaine opilacion which made her melancholicke: who
counceiled the husbande to aduertise his wife to consider her
conscience, and that she was in the handes of God (as&nbsp;thoughe they
which be in health were not in his protection): the husbande which
intirely loued his wyfe, was wyth their woordes made so heauye and
pensife, as for his confort he wrote to the Lord of Auannes, beseechinge
him to take the paynes to visite them, hoping that his sight would
greatly ease and relieue the disease of his wife. Which request the Lord
of Auannes immediatly vppon the recepte of those letters slacked not,
but by poste arriued at his father’s house: at the entrye whereof hee
founde the seruauntes and women makinge great sorrowe and lamentacion
accordinglie as the goodnes of their maistresse deserued: wherewith the
sayde Lorde was so astonned as he stoode stil at the doore like one in a
traunce, vntil he sawe his good father: who imbracing him beganne so
bitterlie to weepe, that he was not able to speake a worde. And so
conueied the sayd Lorde of Auannes vp into the Chamber of his poore
sicke wyfe: who casting vp her languishing eyes looked vppon him: and
reaching his hand vnto her, she strayned the same with all her feeble
force, and imbracinge and kissinge the same made a marueylous plainte,
and sayd vnto him<ins class = "correction" title = ". for ,">. </ins>“O
my Lord, the houre is come that all dissimulacion must cease, and needes
I must confesse vnto you the troth, which I to my greate paine haue
concealed from you: which is, that if you haue borne vnto me greate
affection, beleeue that mine rendred vnto you, hath bin no lesse: but my
sorrow hath farre surpassed your griefe, the smarte whereof I do feele
now against myne hart and will: wherefore, my lord, yee shall
vnderstand, that GOD and mine
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page95" id = "page95">95</a></span>
honour would not suffer mee to disclose the same vnto you, fearing to
increase in you that which I desired to be diminished: but knowe yee, my
Lorde, that the woordes which so many tymes you haue vttered vnto mee,
haue bred in me such griefe, as the same be the Instrumentes and
woorkers of my death, wherewyth I am contente sith <span class =
"smallcaps">God</span> did giue mee the grace not to suffer the violence
of my Loue, to blotte the puritye of my conscience and renowne: for
lesse fire then is wythin the kindled harte of mine, hath ruinated and
consumed most famous and stately buildinges. Nowe my hart is well at
ease, sithe before I dye, I&nbsp;haue had power to declare myne
affection, which is equall vnto yours, sauing that the honor of men and
women be not a like: beseechinge you, my Lorde, from henceforth not to
feare to addresse your selfe to the greatest and moste vertuous Ladies
that you can finde: for in such noble hartes do dwell the strongest
passions, and there the same be moste wisely gouerned: and God graunt
that the grace, beautie and honestie, which be in you, do not suffer
your loue to trauell wythout fruite: haue in remembrance good, my Lord,
the stabilitie of my constante minde, and do not attribute that to
crueltie which ought to be imputed to honor, conscience and vertue:
which are thinges a thousande times more acceptable, then the expence
and losse of transitorie life. Nowe, farewell, my Lorde, recommendinge
vnto your honour the state of my husband your good father, to whom I
pray you to reherse the troth of that which you doe know by mee, to the
intent that he may be certefied how dearely I haue loued God and him:
for whose sake I beseech you to absente your selfe out of my sight: for
from henceforth I do meane holye to giue my selfe to the contemplacion
of those promises which God hath louingly decreed, before the
constitucion of the world.” In saying so shee kissed him, and imbraced
him wyth all the force of her feeble armes. The sayde Lorde, whose hart
was dead for compassion, as her’s was in dying through griefe and
sorrow, without power to speake one onely worde, withdrew himselfe out
of her sight and laye downe vpon a bed within an inner chamber: where he
fainted many times. Then the gentlewoman called for her husbande, and
after she had giuen him many goodly lessons, shee recommended him to the
Lord of Auannes, assuringe him that
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page96" id = "page96">96</a></span>
nexte to his parson, of all the men in the worlde shee had him in
greateste estimacion: and soe kissinge her husbande shee badde him
farewell. And then was brought vnto her the holye Sacramente, which shee
receyued with such ioye, as one certaine and sure of her Saluacion, and
perceyuinge her sighte begynne to fayle, and her strength diminishe she
pronounced aloude: <i>In manus tuas</i>, &amp;c. At which crie the Lorde
of Auannes rose vp from the bedde, and piteously beholding her, he
viewed her with a swete sighe, to rendre her gloriouse ghost to him
which had redemed it. And when he perceiued that shee was dead, hee ran
to the dead bodie, which liuing he durst not approche for feare, and
imbraced and kissed the same in such wise, as muche a doe there was to
remoue her corps out of his armes: wherof the husband was very much
abashed, for that he neuer thought that he had borne his wife such
affection. And in saying vnto him: “My Lord, you haue done enough:” they
withdrew them selues together. And after long lamentation, the one for
his wife, and the other for his Lady: the Lord of Auannes told him the
whole discourse of his Loue, and howe vntill her death she neuer
graunted him not so muche as one signe or token of loue, but in place
therof a rebellious minde to his importunate sutes: at the rehersall
whereof, the husbande conceiued greater pleasure and contentment than
euer he did before: which augmented or rather doubled his sorrow and
griefe for losse of such a wife. And all his life time after, in al
seruices and duties he obeyed the Lord of Auannes, that then was not
aboue eightene yeres of age, who retourned to the Courte, and continued
there many yeares without will to see or speake to any woman, for the
sorrow which he had taken for his Lady, and more then two yeres he wore
blacke for mourning apparell. Beholde here the difference betweene a
wise and discrete woman, and one that was wanton and foolish, both which
sortes expressed different effectes of loue: whereof the one receiued a
glorious and commendable death, and the other liued to long to her great
shame and infamie. The one by small sute sone won and obteyned, the
other by earnest requestes and great payne pursued and followed. And
till death had taken order, to ridde her from that pursute, she euer
continued constant.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">King</span> Charles of Fraunce, the eight
of that name, sent into Germany a gentleman called Bernage, lorde of
Cyure besides Amboise: who to make speede, spared neither daye nor
nighte for execution of his Prince’s commaundement. In sutch wyse as
very late in an euening he arriued at the Castle of a Gentleman, to
demaunde lodging, which very hardly he obtained. Howbeit, when the
gentleman vnderstode that he was the seruaunt of such a kyng, he prayed
him not to take it in ill parte the rudinesse of his seruantes because
vppon occasion of certain his wiue’s frends which loued him not, he was
forced to kepe his house so straight. Then Bernage tolde him the cause
of his iourney, wherein the Gentleman offered to doe to the king his
maister all seruice possible. Leading him into his house where he was
feasted and lodged very honorably. When supper was ready, the Gentleman
conueyed him into a parler wel hanged with fayre Tapistrie. And the
meate being set vpon the table, and he required to sit down, he
perceiued a woman comming forth behind the hanging, which was so
beautifull as might be seene, sauing that her head was all shauen, and
apparelled in Almaine blacke. After bothe the Gentlemen had washed,
water was brought to the Gentlewoman, who when she had washed she sat
down also, without speaking to any, or any word spoken vnto her againe.
The Lorde Bernage beholding her well, thought her to be one of the
fayrest Ladies that euer he sawe, if her face had not bene so pale and
her countenaunce so sadde. After she had eaten a litle, she called for
drinke, which one of the seruauntes brought vnto her in a straunge cup:
for it was the head of a dead man trimmed with siluer, wherof she
drancke twice or thrice. When she had supped and washed her handes,
making a reuerence to the Lord of the house, shee retourned backe againe
that way shee came, without speaking to any. Bernage was so much amased
at that straunge sighte, as he waxed very heauie and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page98" id = "page98">98</a></span>
sadde. The gentleman who marked hym, sayde vnto hym: “I&nbsp;see well
that you be astonned at that you saw at the table, but seyng your honest
demeanour, I&nbsp;wyll not keepe it secrete from you, because you shal
not note that crueltie to be done without greate occasion. This
gentlewoman whiche you see, is my wyfe, whom I loued better than was
possible for any man to loue his wyfe. In such sorte as to marry her I
forgat all feare of friendes, and brought her hither in despite of her
parentes. She likewyse shewed vnto me suche signes of loue, as I
attempted a thousande wayes to place her here for her ioye and myne,
where wee lyued a long tyme in suche reste and contentation, as I
thought my self the happiest Gentleman in Christendome. But in a iourney
whiche I made, the attempt whereof myne honour forced me, shee forgot
bothe her selfe, her conscience, and the loue whiche shee bare towardes
mee, and fell in loue with a Gentleman that I brought vp in this house,
whiche her loue vpon my retourne I perceiued to be true. Notwithstanding
the loue that I bare her, was so great as I had no mistrust in her, tyll
sutch tyme as experience did open myne eyes, and sawe the thynge that I
feared more than death. For whiche cause my loue was tourned into furie
and dispayre, so greate, as I watched her so nere, that vppon a daye
fayning my selfe to goe abroade, I&nbsp;hydde my selfe in the chamber
where now shee remayneth. Into the whiche sone after my departure shee
repayred, and caused the Gentleman to come thether. Whome I did beholde
to doe that thinge, which was altogether vnmeete for any man to doe to
her, but my selfe. But when I sawe him mounte vppon the bed after her,
I&nbsp;stepped forth and tooke him betwene her armes, and with my dagger
immediatly did kill him. And because the offence of my wife semed so
great as the doing of her to death was not sufficient to punish her,
I&nbsp;deuised a torment which in mine opinion is worse vnto her than
death. For thus I vse her, I&nbsp;doe locke her vp in the chamber
wherein she accustomed to vse her delightes, and in the companie of hym
that she loued farre better than me. In the closet of which chamber I
haue placed the Anatomie of her friend, reseruing the same as a precious
Iewell. And to the ende shee may not forget him at meales, at the table
before my face, she vseth his skulle in
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page99" id = "page99">99</a></span>
steade of a cup to drinke in, to the intent she may behold him (aliue)
in the presence of hym whom through her owne fault she hath made her
mortal enemy, and him dead and slain for her sake, whose loue she
preferred before mine. And so beholdeth those twoo thinges at dinner and
supper which ought to displease her moste, her enemie liuing, and her
friend dead, and al through her own wickednesse, howbeit I doe vse her
no worse than my self, although shee goeth thus shauen: for the ornament
of the heare doth not appertaine to an adultresse, nor the vayle or
other furniture of the head to an unchast woman. Wherefore she goeth so
shauen, in token she hath lost her honestie. If it please you, sir, to
take the payne to see her, I&nbsp;wil bring you to her.” Whereunto
Bernage willingly assented. And descending into her chamber whiche was
very richely furnished, they founde her sitting alone at the fier. And
the Gentleman drawing a Curteine, whiche was before the Closet, he sawe
the Anatomie of the dead man hanging. Bernage had a great desire to
speake vnto the Ladye, but for feare of her husband he durst not. The
Gentleman perceiuin the same, said vnto him: “If it please you to speake
vnto her, you shal vnderstand her order of talke.” Therwithall Bernage
sayde vnto her: “Madame, if your pacience be correspondent to this
torment, I&nbsp;deme you to be the happiest woman of the worlde.” The
lady with teares trickeling down her eyes with a grace so good and
humble as was possible, spake thus vnto him: “Sir, I&nbsp;doe confesse
my fault to be so great, as all the afflictions and torment that the
Lorde of this place (for I am not worthy to call him husbande) can doe
vnto me, be nothing comparable to the sorrowe I haue conceiued of myne
offence.” And in sayinge so, she began pitifully to weepe. Therewithall
the Gentleman toke Bernage by the hande, and led him forth. The next day
morning he departed about the businesse which the king had sent him.
Notwithstanding, in bidding the Gentleman fare well, he sayde vnto hym:
“Sir, the loue whiche I beare vnto you, and the honor and secretes
wherewith you haue made me priuie, doth force me to saye vnto you howe I
doe thinke good (seing the great repentance of the poore Gentlewoman
your wife) that you doe shewe her mercie. And bicause you be yong and
haue no children, it were a verie great losse and detriment
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page100" id = "page100">100</a></span>
to lose such a house and ligneage as yours is. And it may so come to
passe, that your enemies thereby in time to come may be your heires, and
inioye the goodes and patrimonie whiche you doe leaue behinde you.” The
Gentleman which neuer thought to speake vnto his wife, with those wordes
paused a great while, and in thend confessed his saying to be true,
promising him that if she would continue in that humilitie, he would in

him of the beautie of this Ladie, who sent his Painter called Iohn of
Paris, to bring him her counterfaicte: which with the consent of her
husband, he did. Who after that long penaunce, for a desire he had to
haue children, and for the pitie hee bare to his wyfe which with great
humblenesse receiued that affliction, tooke her vnto hym agayne, and

<p class = "summary">
A President of Grenoble aduertised of the ill gouernement of his wife,
took such order, that his honestie was not diminished, and yet reuenged
the facte.</p>


<p><span class = "firstword">In</span> Grenoble (the chiefe citie of a
Countrie in Fraunce called Daulphine, which citie otherwise is named
Gratianapolis) there was a President that had a very fayre wyfe, who
perceiuing her husbande beginne to waxe olde, fell in loue with a yong
man that was her husband’s Clark, a&nbsp;very propre and handsome
felowe. Vpon a time when her husband in a morning was gone to the
Palace, the clarke entred his chamber and tooke his Maister’s place,
whiche thing one of the presidente’s men, that faithfully had serued him
the space of <span class = "smallroman">XXX.</span> yeres like a trustie
seruant perceiuing, could not keepe it secret, but tolde his Maister.
The President whiche was a wise man, would not beleue it vpon his light
report, but sayde that he did it of purpose to set discord betwene him
and his wife, notwithstanding if the thing were true as he had reported,
he might let him see the thing it selfe, whiche if he did not, he had
good cause to thinke that he had deuised a lye to breake and dissolue
the loue betwene them. The seruaunt did assure him that he would cause
him to see the thing wherof he had tolde him. And one morning so sone as
the President was gone to the Court, and the Clarked entred into his
chamber, the seruaunt sent one of his companions to tel his maister that
he might come in good time, to see the thing that he had declared vnto
him, he himself standing stil at the doore to watch that the partie
might not goe out. The President so sone as he sawe the signe that one
of his men made vnto him, fayning that he was not wel at ease, left the
audience, and spedely went home to his house, where he founde his olde
seruaunt watching at the chamber dore, assuring him for truth that the
Clarke was within, and that he should with spede to goe in. The
President sayd to his seruant: “Do not tarrie at the dore, for thou
knowest ther is no other going out or comming in but onely this, except
a litle closet
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page102" id = "page102">102</a></span>
wherof I alone do beare the keye.” The president entred the chamber, and
found his wife and the Clarke a bed together, who in his shirt fell
downe at the president’s feete, crauing pardon, and his wife much afraid
began to weepe. To whome the President sayde: “For so muche as the thing
which thou hast done is such, as thou maist well consider, that I can
not abyde my house (for thee) in this sort to be dishonored, and the
daughters which I haue had by thee to be disauaunced and abased:
therfore leaue of thy weeping, and marke what I shall doe. And thou
Nicolas (for that was his Clarke’s name) hide thy selfe here in my
closet, and in any wise make no noyse.” When he had so done, he opened
the dore and called in his olde seruaunt, and sayde vnto him: “Diddest
not thou warrant and assure me that thou wouldest let me see my Clarke
and wyfe in bedde together? And vppon thy words I am come hether,
thinking to haue killed my wife, and doe finde nothing to be true of
that which thou diddest tell me. For I haue searched the chamber in
euery place as I will shewe thee.” And with that he caused his seruant
to looke vnder the beddes, and in euery corner. And when the seruant
founde him not, throughly astonned, he sayde to his maister: “Sir,
I&nbsp;sawe him goe into the chamber, and out he is not gone at the
dore: and so farre as I can see he is not here: therefore I thinke the
Diuel must nedes carrie him awaye.” Then his maister rebuked him in
these words: “Thou art a villayn, to set such diuision betwene my wife
and me, wherefore I doe discharge thee from my seruice, and for that
which thou hast done me, I&nbsp;will paye the thy dutie, with the
aduauntage: therefore get thee hence, and take hede that thou doest not
tarrie in this town aboue <span class = "smallroman">XXIIII.</span>
houres.” The President for that he knew him to be an honest and
faithfull seruaunt, gaue him five or sixe yeares wages, and purposed
otherwise to preferre him. When the seruaunt (with ill will and weping
teares) was departed, the President caused his Clark to come out of his
Closet: and after he had declared to his wife and him, what hee thought
of their ill behauiour, he forbad them to shewe no likelyhode of any
such matter, and commaunded his wyfe to attire and dresse her selfe in
more gorgeous apparell, than she was wont
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page103" id = "page103">103</a></span>
to weare, and to haunt and resort to company and feastes, willing the
Clarke to make a better countenaunce on the matter then hee did before,
but whensoeuer he rounded him in the eare and bad him depart, he charged
him after that commaundement not to tarry foure houres in the towne. And
when he had thus done, he retourned to the palace Courte, as though
there hadde no sutche thing chaunced. And the space of fiftene dayes
(contrary to his custome) he feasted his frendes and neighbours, and
after euery those bankettes, he caused the minstrels to play, to make
the Gentlewomen daunce. One daye he seing his wife not to daunce, he
commaunded his Clarke to take her by the hande, and to leade her forth
to daunce, who thinking the President had forgotten the trespasse past,
very ioyfully daunced with her. But when the daunce was ended, the
President faining as though he would haue commaunded him to doe some
thing in his house, bad him in his eare to get him away and neuer to
retourne. Now was the Clark very sorowfull to leaue his Ladye, but yet
no lesse ioyfull he was that his life was saued. Afterwardes when the
President had made all his frendes and kinsfolkes, and all the countrey,
beleue what great loue he bare to his wife, vppon a faire day in the
moneth of May, he went to gather a sallade in his garden, the herbes
whereof after she had eaten, she liued not aboue <span class =
"smallroman">XXIIII.</span> houres after, whereof he counterfaited suche
sorrowe, as no man could suspect the occasion of her death. And by that
meanes he was reuenged of his enemy, and saued the honour of his
house.</p>

<p>“¶ I will not by this Nouell (said Emarsuitte) prayse the conscience
of the President, but herein I haue declared the light behauiour of a
woman, and the great pacience and prudence of a man: Praying you good
Ladies all, not to be offended at the truthe.” “If all women (quo
Parlamente) that loue their Clarkes or seruauntes, were forced to eate
such sallades, I&nbsp;beleue they would not loue their gardens so well
as they doe, but woulde teare and plucke vp all the herbes bothe roote
and rinde, to auoyde those thinges that by death might aduaunce the
honor of their stock and ligneage.” “If sallades be so costly (quod
Hircan) and so daungerous in May, I&nbsp;will prouoke appetite with
other sawces, or els hunger shall be my chiefest.”</p>

<p class = "summary">
A gentleman of Perche suspecting iniurie done vnto him by his friend,
prouoked him to execute and put in proufe the cause of his
suspicion.</p>


<p><span class = "firstword">Besides</span> the countrie of Perche,
there were two Gentlemen, which from the tyme of theyr youthe lyued in
sutche great and perfect amitie, as there was betwene them but one
harte, one bed, one house, one table, and one purse. Long time continued
this perfect frendship: betwene whom there was but one will and one
woorde, no difference in either of them: in so muche as they not onely
semed to be two brethren, but also they appeared in al semblances to be
but one man. One of them chaunced to mary: notwithstanding they gaue not
ouer their frendship, but perseuered in their vsual amitie as they were
wont to doe: and whan they happened to be strained to straight lodging,
the maried gentleman would not stick to suffer his friend to lie with
him and his wife. But yet you ought for frendship sake to consider that
the maried man lay in the mids. Their goodes were common betwene them,
and the mariage did yelde no cause to hinder their assured amitie. But
in processe of time, the felicitie of this worlde (whiche carieth with
it a certaine mutabitie) could not continue in the house, which was
before right pleasaunt and happy: for the maried man forgetting the
faithfull fidelitie of his friend, without any cause conceiued a greate
suspicion betwene hym and his wyfe, from whom he could not dissemble the
case, but sharpely tolde her his mynde. She therewithall was wonderfully
amazed: howbeit, he commaunded her to doe all thinges (one thing
excepted) and to make so muche of his companion as of himselfe.
Neuerthelesse he forbade her to speake vnto hym except it were in the
presence of many. All which she gaue her husbande’s companion to
vnderstande, who would not beleue her, knowyng that hee had neither by
thought or deede done anye thing whereof his companion had cause to be
offended. And likewise because he used to kepe nothing secrete from hym,
he tolde him what he
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page105" id = "page105">105</a></span>
had sayde, praying hym to tell him the truthe of the matter, because he
purposed neither in that, ne yet in any other thing, to geue occasion of
breach of that amitie which of long time they had imbraced. The maried
Gentleman assured him that he neuer thought it, and how they which had
sowen that rumor, had wickedly belied him. Whereunto his companion
replied: “I&nbsp;knowe wel enough that Ielousie is a passion so
intollerable as loue it selfe. And when you shall conceiue that opinion
of Ialousie, yea and it were of my selfe, I&nbsp;should do you no wrong,
for your selfe were not able to kepe it. But of one thing which is in
your power, I&nbsp;haue good matter whereof to complayne, and that is
because you will concele from me your maladie, sith there was no passion
or opinion which you conceiued, that before this time you kept secret
from me. Likewise for my owne parte if I were amorous of your wife, you
ought not to impute it as a fault vnto me, because it is a fier which I
bare not in my handes, to vse at my pleasure. But if I kepe it to my
selfe from you, and indeuour to make youre wife knowe it by
demonstration of my loue, I&nbsp;might then be accompted that
vntrustiest friend that euer liued: and for me I doe assure you that
shee is a right honest and a good woman, and one that my fansie doth
lest fauour (although she were not your wife) of all them that euer I
sawe. But now sithens there is no cause, I&nbsp;do require you that if
you perceiue any suspicion, be it neuer so litle, to tell me of it,
because I would so vse myself, as our frendship which hath indured so
long tyme, might not bee broken for a woman: and if I did loue her aboue
any thing in the worlde, yet surely I would neuer speake worde vnto her,
bicause I doe esteme our frendship better then the greatest treasure.”
His companion swore vnto him very great othes that he neuer thought it,
praying him to vse his house as he had done before. Whereunto he
aunswered: “Sithe you will haue me so to doe, I&nbsp;am content: but I
praye you if hereafter you doe conceiue any sinistre opinion in me, not
to dissemble the same, which if you doe I will neuer continue longer in
your companie.” In processe of time, liuing together according to their
custome, the maried Gentleman entred againe into greater Ielousie than
euer he did, commaunding his wife to beare no more that countenaunce
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page106" id = "page106">106</a></span>
towards him that she was wont to doe. Whiche commaundement she tolde her
husbande’s companion, praying him after that time to forbeare to speake
vnto her, for that she was forbidden to doe the like to him. The
gentleman vnderstanding by wordes and certaine countenaunces, that his
companion had not kept promise, he sayd vnto him in great choler: “To be
Ialous (my&nbsp;companion) is a thing naturall: but bicause thou diddest
sweare vnto me by othes not to dissemble, I&nbsp;can by no meanes
forbeare any longer: for I did euer thinke that betwene thyne harte and
mine, there could be no let and interruption: but to my great griefe and
without anye fault on my part, I&nbsp;doe see the contrarie. For as
muche as thou art not only very Ialous betwene thy wife and mee, but
also thou wouldest dissimulate and couer the same, so that in the ende
thy maladie and disease continuing so long, is altered into mere malice,
and lyke as oure loue hath bene the greateste that hathe bene seene in
oure tyme, euen so our displeasure and hatred is nowe moste mortall.
I&nbsp;haue done so mutche as lyeth in mee, to auoyde this
inconuenience, but sithe thou hast suspected me to be an ill man, and I
haue still shewed my selfe to be the contrary, I&nbsp;doe sweare, and
therwithal assure thee, by my faith, that I am the same thou thinkest me
to be, and therefore from henceforth take hede of me: for since
suspicion hath separated the from my loue and amitie, despite shall
deuide me from thine.” And albeit that his companion would haue made him
beleue the contrarie, and that hee mistrusted hym nothing at all, yet he
withdrewe his part of his moueables and goodes that before were common
betweene them, so that then both their hartes and goodes were so farre
separated as before they were vnited and ioyned together. In such wyse
as the vnmaried Gentleman neuer ceassed till he had made his companion
cockolde, according to his promise.</p>

The piteous death of an Amorouse Gentleman, for the slacke comfort geuen
him to late, by his beloued.</p>


<p><span class = "firstword">Betwene</span> Daulphine and Prouence,
there was a gentleman, more riche and better furnished with beautie,
vertue, and good condicions, then with the goodes of fortune: who fill
in loue with a gentlewoman that for this time shall want a name, for
respecte of her parentes that are come of honorable houses, and the
Gentleman’s name also shalbe vntolde, for like respecte, although
altogether not so honorably allied, as the Gentlewoman that he loued,
and yet the historie very certen and true. And bicause his degree was
not so high as hers, hee durst not discouer his affection: for the loue
which he bare her, was so good and perfect, as rather would he haue bene
tormented with the panges of death, then couet the least aduauntage that
might redounde to her dishonor. And seing his state to base in respecte
of hers, had no hope to marry her. Wherefore he grounded his loue vpon
none other foundation and intent, but to loue her with all his power so
perfectlye as was possible, which in the ende came vnto her knowledge.
And the Gentlewoman knowing and seing the honest amitie which he bare
her, to be ful of vertue, ioyned with chast and comly talke, felt her
selfe right happie to be beloued and had in prise, of a personage so
well condicioned, practising dayly cherefull countinaunce towardes him
(whiche was the best rewarde he pretended to haue) whereof he conceiued
great ease and contentment. But malice the cancred enemy of all reste
and quiet, could not long abide this honest and happie life. For some
frowning at his good happe, (as&nbsp;malice euer accompanieth a well
disposed mynde) tolde the mother of the mayden, howe they marueiled that
the Gentleman should bee so familiar in her house, inferring
therewithall that the beautie of her daughter was the only cause, with
whom they sawe him many times to vse secrete and priuat speach. The
mother which by no meanes doubted the honestie of the Gentleman, no more
then shee did
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page108" id = "page108">108</a></span>
of her own children, was very sorie to vnderstand that some shold be
offended at that their familiarity. She thought therfore to shunne the
cause of their offence. And at length, (fearing that slaunder might be
raised of malice) she required the Gentleman for a tyme to haunt no more
her house, as he was wont to doe. A&nbsp;thing to him of harde
digestion, knowing his own innocencie, and lesse desert to be estranged
from the house, for respect of the honest talke he vsed to the yonge
gentlewoman. Notwithstanding, to stoppe the rage of malicious tongues,
he withdrew himself, till he thought the brute was ceased, and then
retourned after his wonted maner: whose absence nothing abridged his
auncient good will. And he began no soner to be familiar there again,
but he vnderstode that the mayden should be maried to a Gentleman, that
was not so ritche and noble (as&nbsp;semed to hym) and therfore he
thought he should receiue great wrong, if she were bestowed vpon that
Gentleman, and not on hym, that had bene so long a sutor. And thereupon
conceiued corage to preferre hym selfe in playne tunes, if choyse were
geuen to the maiden. Howebeit, the mother and other of her kynne,
sollicited and chose the other gentleman because (in&nbsp;dede) he was
more welthie. Whereat the poore gentleman fretted with displeasure,
seing that his Ladie should for worldly mucke be defrauded of her
greatest ioye, by little and little without other maladie, began to
languishe, and in litle tyme was so altered, as in his face appeared the
visage of death. Neuerthelesse he could not forbeare the house of his
beloued, but continually from time to time made his repaire thether to
fede himselfe with the baulme of that beautie, which he thought would
prolong his dayes, but it was the onely abridgement. In thend the poyson
he sucked by the viewe of that beautie, consumed his strength, and force
failing him, was constrained to kepe his bedde. Whereof he would not
aduertise her whome he loued, for greuing her, knowing well that she
would bee tormented with the newes. And so suffring him selfe to runne
the race of past recourye, lost also his appetite to eate or drinck, and
therewithall his slepe and rest fayled, in suche plight as within short
space he was consumed in visage and face, as it grewe to be vglie and
cleane out of knowledge. Brought to

<a name = "page109" id = "page109">109</a></span>
this lowe estate, one of his frends certified the mother of his mistres,
that was a very charitable and kinde Gentlewoman, and loued so well the
man, as if all their parentes and kinne had bene of her’s and the
mayden’s opinion they would haue preferred the honestie of him, before
the great substance of the other. But the frendes of the father’s side
by no meanes would consent vnto it. Yet the good Gentlewoman and her
daughter (for all the other’s frowardnes) vouchsafed to visit the poor
gentleman whom they founde, rather declining towards death, then in hope
of life. And knowing his ende to approche, he was shriuen and receiued
the holy Sacrament, purposing of present passage by panges of death,
neuer to see any of his frendes againe. Being in this case and yet seing
her, whome he counted to be his life and sauftie, felte suche soudden
recouerie, as hee threwe hym selfe alofte his bedde and spake these
wordes vnto her: “What cause hath drieuen you hither (mistres myne) by
takyng paines to visite him, who hath one of his feet alreadie within
the graue, the other stepping after with conuenient speede, for
execution whereof you bee the onely Instrument.” “Howe so, sir?” sayde
the mother. “Is it possible that hee, whom we so derely loue, can
receiue death by our offences? I&nbsp;pray you sir to tell me, what
reason leadeth you to speake these wordes.” “Madame,” sayde he, “so long
as I could, I&nbsp;dissembled the loue that I bare to my deare mistres
your daughter: so it is that my parentes and frendes speaking of a
mariage betwene her and me, haue clattred thereof moe nedeles woordes
then I desired, by waying the mishap that might insue, and nowe doth
happe past all hope not for my particular pleasure, but bicause I knowe
with none other she shalbe so well intreated nor beloued as she should
haue bene with me. The benefit which I see she hath lost, is the most
perfect frende the best affected seruaunt that euer shee had in this
worlde, the losse wherof summoneth death to arrest the carcase, that
should haue bene imployed for her seruice, which intierly was conserued
and should haue bene for her sake: but sithe nowe it can serue her to no
purpose, the simple losse shall redounde to greatest gaine. I&nbsp;meane
my selfe (good Ladies bothe) that lieth bewrapped in death before your
faces, whose withered
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page110" id = "page110">110</a></span>
clammes hath catched the same within her reach, and hath warned the
clocke to tolle the dolefull bell for his poor lovyng ghoste, nowe
stretchynge out for the winding shete to shrowde his maigre corps, all
forworne with the watche and toile, that such poore men (affected with
like care) do feele. It is my selfe, that erst was rouing amid the
troupe of Courtlie knightes decked with comely face, whose hewe dame
Nature stayned with the colours of her golden art. It is I that of late
was loued of that Nymphe, and earthie Goddesse, who with courtinge
countenaunce imbraced the place where I did stande, and kissed the steps
wherein I trode. It is my selfe I saye, that whilom in painefull blisse,
did bath my selfe, and fedde mine eyes with the happie viewe of the
heauenliest creature that euer God did make. And by forgoing of those
ioyes by <ins class = "correction" title = "error for ‘to’">to to</ins>
much mishap, and sacred famine of cursed mucke, I&nbsp;am thus pined as
ye see, and wrapte in hopeles state.” The mother and doughter hearinge
this complainte, did their indeuour to cheere him vp, and the mother
sayde unto him: “Be of good courage sir, and I promise you my fayth,
that if God giue you health, my doughter shal haue none other husband
but you, and behold her here, whom I commaunde to make you present
promise.” The mayden weeping with a virginall shamefastnes, consented to
her mother’s hest. But knowing when he was recouered, that he should not
haue her, and that the mother was so liberal of her fayre words, to
recomfort him and assaye if she might restore him: he said vnto them,
that if those words had bin pronounced three monethes past, he had bin
the lustiest and most happie gentleman of Fraunce: but helpe offred so
late, was past beliefe and hope. But when he saw, that they went about
to force him to beleeue it, he said vnto them: “Now that I see ye go
about to promise the good tourne which can neuer chaunce vnto mee, yea
although consent ioyned with vnfayned promise desires the effect, for
respect of the feeble state wherein I am: yet let me craue one thing at
your hands, farre lesse then that ye offer, which hitherto I neuer durst
be so bolde to aske.” Whereunto they both assented and swore to performe
it, intreating him not to be ashamed to requyre it. “I&nbsp;humbly
beseech ye (quoth hee) to deliuer her into mine armes whom ye haue
promised to be my
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page111" id = "page111">111</a></span>
wife, and commaunde her to imbrace and kisse me.” The mayden not vsed to
such priuie sutes, ne yet acquainted with such secrete facts, made some
difficultie, but her mother gaue her expresse commaundement to doe it,
perceyuing in him no likelihode or force of a man to liue. The maiden
then vpon that commaundement, aduaunced herselfe uppon the bedde of the
poore pacient, saying vnto him: “Sir, I&nbsp;beseech you to be of good
cheere.” The languishing creature, so hard as he could for his extreeme
debilitie, stretched forth his faint consumed armes, and with al the
force of his body imbraced the cause of his death, and kissinge her with
his colde and wanne mouth, held her so long as he could, and then spake
vnto the mayden: “The loue which I haue borne you hath bin so great, and
the good will so honest, as neuer (mariage excepted) I&nbsp;wished anye
other thinge of you, but that which I presentlye haue, throughe the
wante whereof and with the same I will ioyfully render my spirite to
God, who is the parfaicte Loue, and truest Charitie, whoe knoweth the
greatnes of my loue and the honestie of my desire: humblie beseeching
him, (that nowe I hauing my desire betweene mine armes,) to interteigne
my ghost within his blessed bosome.” And in saying so he caught her
againe betweene his armes with such vehemencie, as the feeble hart not
able to abide that assault, was abandoned of all powers and mouinges:
for the instant ioye so dilated and stretched forth the same, as the
siege of the soule gaue ouer, making his repaire and flighte to his
Creator: and because the senceles bodye rested withoute life, it gaue
ouer his holde. Howbeit the loue, which the Damosell had still kept
secrete, at that time shewed it self so strong and mightie, as the
mother and seruauntes of the dead Gentleman had much a do to separate
that vnion, but by force they haled away the liuing, almost deade with
the deade. After the funerall was done with honourable exequies: but the
greatest triumph was spent in teares, weepinges and cryes, specially by
the gentlewoman, which so much more were manifeste after his death, as
before in his life time they were dissembled, bestowinge them as an
expiacion or sacrifice, to satisfie the wrong she had done vnto him. And
afterwards (as&nbsp;I haue heard tell) she was maried to one, for
mitigacion of her sorow, that neuer was partaker
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page112" id = "page112">112</a></span>
of the ioye of her harte. See here good Ladies an Image of perfect loue,
that so muche had seazed vpon thaffections of this amorous Gentleman, as
the pange neuer gaue ouer, till death (the rest of all troubles) had
diuided life from the body. Yet some perchaunce for the desperate part
of this hopeles louer, will terme him to be a fonde louing foole: and
say that it is not meete that they should neglecte theyr liues for
womens sakes, which were not created but for their helpe and comforte.
And that being true as verifyed and auouched by Scriptures, there is no
cause of feare to demaunde that of them, which God hath enioyned them to
giue vs. In deede a sensuall loue, and such as is grounded to satisfye
beastly luste, is a thinge horrible to Nature, and abhominable in the
sight of him that made both those creatures, whom he fraughted with
reason and knowledge for the refusall of those vices, which are onely to
be applied to beastes voyde of reason. But loue founded in the soyle of
Vertue, for auoyding carnall lust exercized in the state of Wedlocke, or
first begonne and practized for that ende, is very ciuil and to be
honoured. And if that loue attaine not equall successe, through parents
default or vnkindnes of frendes or other humane accidents, if that loue
so perce the hart, or otherwyse afflict the pacient with dispaire of
helpe, and so occasioneth death, it is not to be termed follie or
dotage, but to be celebrated with honourable titles. The honest amitie
then of this gentleman, borne long time to this gentlewoman, meriteth
euerlasting praise: for to finde such great chastitie in an amorous
hart, is rather a thing deuine then humaine. A&nbsp;mocion moued aboue

<p class = "summary">
A Gentlewoman of the Courte, very pleasauntly recompenced the seruice of
a kinde seruaunte of her’s, that pursued her with seruice of loue.</p>


<p><span class = "firstword">In</span> the Courte of king Fraunces, the
first of that name, not longe sithens Frenche king, the graunde father
of Henry the 3 of that name now raigning: there was a Gentlewoman of
good grace and interteignment, wanting not both minde and witte, such as
the like of her sexe, are not to seeke, vnder what climate soeuer they
be borne and bred, whose comly demeaner, curteous behauiour and eloquent
speache, was agreeable to her other qualities of nature’s giftes:
whereby she gayned the hartes and good minds of nombers of seruauntes,
with whom shee was cunning ynough to spend her time, (hauing respect to
the sauftie and saufgard of her honor, which she preferred before all
other solace) by such delectable consumption of time, as they that could
not tell howe els to imploie their leasure, thoughte themselues most
blessed, if they might attaine the delightfull presence of this well
nourtered Dame. For they that made greatest assuraunce of her fidelitie,
were in dispayre, and the most desperat were yet in some hope to winne
her. Howbeit in deceyuing the most nomber, she could not forbeare
intirely to loue one, who for his part was not able to plaie the
counterfait, to colour the substance of his longe pursute: but as
nothing is sure and stable, their loue tourned to displeasure, and by
frequent renewing of what was well knowen the hole Court was not
ignoraunt, what deuocion thone did beare to thother. One day the
Gentlewoman, aswell to let him know that his affection was not bestowed
in vaine, as to make him to feele some smart and paine for his louing
seruice, the more louingly to forde him on, with preety morsells of her
dissembling concept, made show vnto him of greater fauour, then euer she
did before: for which cause he that was faultles either in deedes of
armes, or in prowesse of loue, began liuely and valiantly to folow her,
to whom long before with gentlenes and humilitie he
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page114" id = "page114">114</a></span>
had many times bin a suppliante. Who fayning that she was not able any
longer to rest obstinate, made semblance of a womanly pitie and accorded
to his demaund. Telling him that for respect of his tedious trauaile,
she was now disposed to go to her chamber, (which was in a Gallerie of
the Castell where that time the kinge did lie) where shee knew was none
that could hinder what they two intended: willing him not to faile but
so sone he saw her depart the place she was in, to folow after to her
chamber, where he should finde her alone, tarying for him with good
deuocion. The gentleman beleeuinge her appointmente, was readie to leape
out of his skinne for ioye: and therewithall began to dalye and sport
with other Ladies, attending the time of her departure. She wanting not
the practize of any fine sleight or subtile pollicie, most pregnaunte in
birds of her Ayrie, called two of the greatest Ladies to the present
chamber window and said vnto them: “If it may please you good Ladies,
I&nbsp;will discouer vnto you the pretiest pastime of the world.” They
which hard the grief of melancholie, besoughte her to tell what it was.
“Thus it is” (quoth shee) “such a gentleman, whom you know very well, to
be both honest and vertuous, hath longe time (as&nbsp;partlie you haue
by to much experience seene,) gone about diuers wayes to winne that,
which he shall neuer get: for when I began to applie my fancie towards
him, he (vnconstant) ceased not to couet and folow other Ladies with
like pursute hee did me: whereat I conceyued such more then spitefull
hatred, as notwithstanding my outwarde semblaunce, I&nbsp;coueted
reuenge. Nowe therefore maistresse, Occasion hath lente me a porcion of
oportunitie, to be requited of his vaine and fickle sute: which is, that
hauinge appointed him to come to my chamber, whither he meaneth
presently to follow me, it maye please you to giue heedefull eye and
watch: and that when hee hath passed alonge the Galerie, and is gone vp
the stayers, that both of you wil recline your heads out of this window
to helpe me singe the holding of the Caroll, that I meane to chaunte
vnto him. And then shall you see the raging choler of this Gentleman,
that at other times presumed to be a quiet Suter: wherat perhaps through
his malapert boldnes, it cannot dash his blushles face, but yet if he do
not deale vnto me like spiteful reproch in open
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page115" id = "page115">115</a></span>
hearing, I&nbsp;know full well in hart he will wishe me <span class =
"smallroman">X. M.</span> mischifes.”
This conclusion was not spoken without treble laughter: for there was no
gentlemen in all the Courte, that had warred so much with the woman kind
as hee, and yet welbeloued and esteemed of euery one, that listed not to
be intrapped within his daunger. Therfore these Ladies thinking to carie
awaye some part of the glorie, which one alone hoped to atchieue vpon
this gentleman, were contente to assent to the other’s liking. So sone
then as they saw her depart, that purposed this enterprise, they began
to espie the countenaunce of the betrayed partie, who paused not long
before he exchaunged the place: and when he was oute of the chamber, the
Ladies trayned after, to lose no part of the sport, and went the faster
that he might not be out of theyr sight. And he that doubted not the
successe, threwe his cape about his necke to hide his face, and went
downe the staiers out into the Court, and afterwards mounted vp againe:
but perceyuing some approche which he was loth should be a witnes, he
went downe againe, returning another way on the other side. All which
the Ladies sawe, vnknowen to him. But when he came to the stayers where
he beleeued verely, that he might surely enter into his Maistres
chamber, the two Ladies put they heads out of the window, and
incontinently perceyued the gentlewoman alofte, crying out a lowde,
“A&nbsp;theefe, a&nbsp;theefe:” wherunto they two below aunswered with
so vehement voyce, doubling the other’s outcrie, as all the castell
ronge of it. I&nbsp;leaue for you to consider in what despite this
gentleman fled to his lodginge, but not so closely, but that he was
ouertaken by those that knew this misterie: who afterwards oftentimes
reproched this fact vnto him, speciall she that had deuised the reuenge:
but hee had armed himselfe with aunswers and defences so readely, as he
told them that he foreknew their deuise, and mente nothing by his
pilgrimage but to solace his beloued. For of her loue long time before
he was out of all hope, as hauing reasonable proofe by his longe pursute
and seruice. Howbeit the Ladyes would not hold his excuse for a veritie,
which euen to this day hangeth in suspence.</p>

<p class = "summary">
The honest and maruellous loue of a mayden of noble house, and of a
gentleman that was base borne, and howe a Queene did impeche and let
their mariage, with the wise aunswere of the mayde to the Queene.</p>


<p><span class = "firstword">There</span> was in Fraunce a Queene, who
in her company and traine broughte vp many maydens, that were issued of
great and honourable progenie: amonges other that serued this Queene
there was one named Rolandine, which was nere kinne to the Queene. But
she for a certaine displeasure conceyued against her father, bare vnto
the yonge gentlewoman no greate good will. This Maiden, although shee
was none of the fayrest, yet so wyse and vertuous as many great Lords
and personages made sute to her for mariage, to whom she rendred for
earnest sutes, cold aunsweares: because shee knew her father to be more
bent to keeping of money, then to thaduauncement of his children: and
her Maistresse (as&nbsp;is before said) bare vnto her so little fauour
as they which esteemed the Queene’s good grace, woulde neuer make anye
sute vnto her. Thus by father’s negligence and Maistres disdaine, the
poore gentlewoman remayned long time vnmaried. And as shee that forcibly
was payned, not so much for griefe of mariage, as for that shee was not
required or sued vnto, became so werie of worldly life, as deuoutly she
bent herselfe to <span class = "smallcaps">God</span>, and by forsakinge
the toyes and brauerie of the Courte, passed her time in prayer, or els
in other vertuous exercise: and by withdrawing herselfe to this kinde of
life, she spent her youth so soberlie and deuoutly as was possible for a
woman to do. When she approched nere the age of <span class =
"smallroman">XXX.</span> yeares, there was a gentleman a bastarde borne,
of right honorable house, a&nbsp;uery curteous and honest personage,
whose every riches and beautie was such, as no Lady or gentlwoman for
pleasure would haue chosen him to husband. This poore gentleman was
voide of frends for maintenaunce of lyuing, and vnhappie in mariage
sutes, although he pursued many, till at length he borded this poore
Gentlewoman Rolandine: for their Fortunes, complexions
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page117" id = "page117">117</a></span>
and condicions were very like, and by vse of seuerall complaints made
one to another, ech of them fell in ernest loue with the other: and
being both thrall vnto mishap, they sought desired comforte by vertuous
and honest talke: and by that vse and frequentacion greater loue
increased and grew betwene them. Those which had seene the maiden so
straungly retired from wonted demeanor, as she would speake to none, now
marking her continuallie to interteigne the bastard gentleman,
incontinently conceiued ill opinion of her, and told the mother of the
Queene’s maids (called Modesta) that she ought not to suffer such
familiaritie betweene them. Which report Modesta reuealed to Rolandine,
sayinge that diuers persons did speake euill of her, for that she vsed
to talke with the bastard, that neither was of sufficient abilitie for
her to marie, ne yet of beautie worthie to be beloued. Rolandine which
daily was more rebuked for her austeritie of life, then for worldly
toyes, sayd vnto Modesta her gouernesse: “Alas, mother, you see that I
cannot haue a husband according to the worthines of my bloud, and that
dailye I haue auoyded those which be beautifull and yonge: for feare to
incurre the inconuenience wherinto I haue seene other to fall: and now
hauing chosen this wise and vertuous gentleman, who preacheth vnto me
words that be good and godly, what wrong do they to me that make this
report, sith in this honest order I doe receiue consolacion of my
griefes?” The good old Lady who loued the maiden (which she called
maistresse) as herselfe, said vnto her: “I&nbsp;see well, that you are
worse delt withall at your father and maistres handes then you deserue.
Howbeit sith such reporte is made of your honor, you ought to refuse to
speake vnto him, although he were your naturall brother.” Rolandine
weeping saide vnto her: “Mother, for so much as you aduise me therunto,
I&nbsp;will performe your request, although it be very straunge that
without slaunder, a&nbsp;woman can haue no comfort or seeke freedome
without misreport.” The bastard gentleman, as he was before accustomed,
came to visite her, but she tolde him (a&nbsp;farre&nbsp;of) those words
which her gouernesse had said vnto her: and with teares prayed him to
refraine for a time to speake vnto her, vntill the brute and rumor were
somewhat appaised: which thing he did at her request. But
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page118" id = "page118">118</a></span>
during this long time, either of them hauing loste their consolacion,
began to feele such torment within themselues, as shee for her part
neuer felte the like. She ceased not from praying vnto God, from goinge
on pilgrimage, and fasting: for this vnacquainted loue brought her to
such disquiet as she could not rest the space of one houre. Wherewith
the noble bastard was no lesse tormented: but he which had alreadie
minded in hart to loue her and pursue her till mariage, and hauing
respecte (for loue sake) to the honor he should acquire by the same,
thought to finde meanes to declare his minde vnto her, and aboue al
things to get the good wil of her gouernesse: which he did, declaring
vnto her the miserie wherein her poore maistresse remayned, which was
voide of al comfort and other frendship. Then the poore old Lady
Modesta, gaue him thankes for the honest affection that hee bare to her
maistresse: and deuised meanes how the two louers might impart their
minds together. Rolandine fayned herselfe to be sicke of a Mygrim and
paine in her heade, the brute of whose maladie was feared to be greater
then it was, and so concluded betwene them that when her companion were
gone into the chamber, they two should remaine together alone to
satisfie ech other with mutuall talke. The bastard gentleman was very
glad, and ruled himselfe holy by the councell of the Gouernesse, in such
sort as when he liste, he spake vnto his louer and vertuous Lady: but
this contencaion did not indure: for the Queene who loued her but a
little, inquired what Rolandine did so long in her Chamber, and one made
aunswere that it was by reason of her sicknes. Albeit there was another
which knewe to well the cause of her absence, sayde vnto her, that the
ioye which Rolandine had to speake vnto the bastard was able to ease her
Mygrim. The Queene which found out the veniall sinnes of other, by
mortall offences in herselfe, sent for her, and forbad her in any wyse
not to speake vnto the bastard, except it were in the hall or within her
owne Chamber. The Gentlewoman made as though she vnderstode her not, but
mildlie aunswered that, is shee knew any talke betweene them might
offend her maiestie, she would neuer speake vnto him againe.
Notwithstanding she determined to finde out some other secret meanes
that the Queene should not know of their meeting: which
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page119" id = "page119">119</a></span>
was this. The Wednesday, Fridaye, and Saturday, the gentlewoman vsed to
fast, and for that purpose kept her Chamber with her Gouernesse Modesta,
where she had leysure to talke (whilest the reste did suppe) with him
whom she began so earnestlie to loue: and as constrainte of time did
force their talke to be shorte, the greater was their affection in
vtteraunce of the same: because for the doing therof they stole time, as
the theefe doth his desired praye. This order of their contentacion
could not proceede so secretely, but that a certaine varlet a yeoman of
the Chamber, chaunced to see him resort vnto her vpon a fasting day, and
told it in such place wher of some hearer, it was disclosed to the
Queene herself, who was so sore offended as neuer after that time the
poore bastard gentleman durste once attempt to go into the maiden’s
chamber againe. And to thintent that he might not lose the commodity of
talke with her, whom he so derely loued, oftentimes he fayned himselfe
to go on pilgrimage, and in the euening returned to the Church and
chapell of the Castel, in the habite of a frier, or Iacobin (so&nbsp;wel
disguised and altered, as no creature could know him) and thither
repaired the gentlewoman Rolandine, with her Gouernesse to enterteigne
him. He marking the great loue that she bare him, feared not to say vnto
her: “Madame, you see the daunger which I hasard for your seruice, and
the warnings that the Queene hath giuen for our talke. You see on
thother side what a father you haue, who careth not after what sort he
bestow you in mariage: and you hauinge refused so many greate states and
noble men, I&nbsp;know not one, either farre or neare, that is minded to
haue you. I&nbsp;confesse my selfe to be but poore, and that you may
marie diuers gentlemen of greater reputacion and richesse, then I am:
but if loue and good wil were deemed treasure and richesse, then woulde
I presume to be the richest gentleman of the world. God hath indowed you
with great plentie of goodes, and you are yet in choise to haue more:
and if I were so happie as you would vouchsafe to chose me for your
husband, I&nbsp;would accompt my selfe to be vnto you both husband,
frend and seruaunt, all the dayes of my life: and againe, if you should
take one equall to your nobilitie (a&nbsp;thinge very harde to finde) he
would rule and gouerne ouer you, and haue more respecte to your goodes,
then to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page120" id = "page120">120</a></span>
your person, to your beautie then to your vertue: and in triumphinge
with dispence of that you haue, hee maye chaunce to intreate you
otherwise then you deserue. The desire of this contentacion, and the
feare that I haue, least you should graunte it to some other, do force
me to beseech you, that by one only meanes you would make me happie and
your selfe the most contented and best intreated woman that euer was.”
Rolandine giuing eare to that communication which shee herselfe ment to
haue pronounced, aunswered him with stoute courage: “I&nbsp;am very glad
and wel pleased that you haue begunne the sute your self, which I of
long time haue determined to breake vnto you: for which cause these two
yeres past as you know, I&nbsp;haue not ceased to thincke and deuise all
the reasons and arguments for and against you, that I could inuent: but
in thend for so much as I do meane to take vpon me the state of
Matrimonie, it is time that I begin to chose such husbande, with whom I
shall in my conscience like to liue at rest and quiet all the dayes of
my life: and amidde all the troupe of my thoughts in choise,
I&nbsp;cannot finde anye one, were he neuer so faire, riche or noble,
with whom my hart and minde can so well agree and match as with you.
I&nbsp;know that by marying of you I shall not offende God, but rather
do the thinge that hee commaundeth. And touching my Lord my father, he
hath had so litle consideracion of my perferment, and so often refused
it, as the law now will suffice, that I giue my selfe in mariage
withoute his consent, and therefore cannot disenherite me, or worthely
thincke ill of me: and by hauing a husband (a&nbsp;thing appertinent to
women kinde) such as you be, I&nbsp;shall esteeme my selfe the richest
woman of the worlde. As for the Queene my maistresse, I&nbsp;oughte not
to take any care or remorse of conscience by displeasing her, to obey
God: for she hath not ceased to hinder that aduauncement, which in my
youth I mighte haue had, and by paine and diligence towards her did well
deserue: but to thend you may vnderstand, that the loue and good will
which I beare you, is founded vppon vertue and honor, you shall promise
me, that if I doe accorde this mariage, you shall neuer purchase or
require the consummacion thereof, Vntill my father be deade, or els do
finde some meanes to make him consente hereunto.” Which
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page121" id = "page121">121</a></span>
the bastard gentleman willingly did graunt: and vppon these promises and
termes, either of them gaue eche other a ringe in the name of mariage,
and did kisse together in the Church before God, whom they toke to
witnes of their assurance, and neuer after betwene them was any other
priuie fact committed, but only kissing. This litle easement of mind did
greatly satisfie the harts of these two perfect louers: and were a great
while without seing ech other, liuing only by this assurance. There was
no place where honour mighte be gotten, but thereunto the bastarde made
his repaire with so great delight, as he thought he could neuer be poore
for respect of that riche wife which God had prouided for him. Which
wyfe in his absence, did euer continue her absolute amitie towards that
gentleman: and although many made sute yet they receyued none other
aunswere from her but deniall, and for that she had remayned so long
time vnmaried, she was minded neuer to take vppon her that state. This
her aunswere was so generall as the Queene heard of it, and asked her
for what occasion shee was so determined. Rolandine saide vnto her, that
it was to obey her: for that shee knew shee would neuer suffer her to
marie, because in time and place where she might haue bin honorablie
matched to her well liking, she denied the same, and that the vertue of
pacience had taught her to contente herselfe with the state wherein she
was. And still as she was sued for in mariage, she rendred like
aunswere. When the warres were ended, and the bastarde returned to the
Courte, shee neuer spake vnto him in open presence, but wente alwayes
into some Church to interteigne him vnder colour of Confession: for the
Queene had forbidden both him and her, that they should not talke
together, vnlesse it were before companye vpon paine of losse of their
liues. But honest loue, which feareth no defence, was more prest to find
meanes, for their mutuall talke, then their enemies were ready to
separate the same: and vnder the habite or colour of all the religions
they could deuise, they continued that honest amitie, vntil the king
remoued into a house of pleasure, not so nere as the Ladies were able to
go on foote to that Church, as they were to the Church of the Castell,
which was not situate in such conueniente wyse for their purpose, as
they could secretely
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page122" id = "page122">122</a></span>
repaire (vnder colour of confession) to talke together: notwithstanding
if on the one side occasion fayled, loue found out another for their
contentment: for there arriued a Lady to the Court, to whom the bastard
was very nere kin. This Lady with her sonne were lodged in the king’s
house, and the chamber of this yong prince was far beyond the body of
the lodging, where the king himselfe did lie: but so nere vnto
Rolandine’s Chamber as he might both see and speake vnto her, for their
windowes were properlie and directly placed at either corner of the
house: in which chamber (being ouer the hall) were lodged al the Ladies
of honor, the companions of Rolandine. Who beholding many times the yong
king at that window, caused the bastard to be aduertized therof by her
gouernesse: who after he had well beholden the place, made as though he
had great delighte to read vpon a booke of the Knightes of the Round
Table, that lay in the chamber window of the yong king: and when euery
man was gone to dinner, he prayed the yeoman to suffer him to make an
end of the historie, and to shut him within the chamber. The other which
knew him to be the kinsman of his maistres, and an assured man, suffred
him to read so long as he liste. On thother side Rolandine came vnto her
window, who to find occasion to tarrie there the longer, fayned to haue
a paine in her leg, and dined and supped in so good time, as she went no
more to the ordinarie of the Ladies: wher she began to set herselfe a
worke about the making of a bed of Crimson silke, placing her worke vpon
the window, as desirous to be alone. And when she saw no man to be
there, shee interteigned her husband, to whom she might speake in secret
wise, so as none was able to vnderstande them: and when any person came
nere, she coughed and made a signe that the bastard might withdraw
himselfe. They that were appointed to watche them, thought vndoubtedlie
that their loue was past and ended, because she went not out of the
Chamber, wher safely he coulde not see her, for that hee was forbidden
the same. Vppon a day the mother of the yong Prince being in her sonne’s
Chamber, repayred to the windowe where that great booke did lie, and
shee had not staied there long, but one of Rolandine’s fellowes which
was within her Chamber saluted her. The lady asked her how Rolandine
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page123" id = "page123">123</a></span>
did, who sayd that shee might very wel see her, if it were her pleasure:
and caused her to come to the window wyth her night geare vppon her
head. And after they had talked a while of her sicknes they withdrew
themselues. The other ladie espying the great booke of the Round Table,
sayde to her yeoman of the Chamber: “I&nbsp;do marueille much why yong
men do imploie themselues to read such follies.” The yeoman made
aunsweare, that he marueled much more, why men of good yeres, counted
and esteemed wise and discrete, should haue greater delight in reading
of such trifles, then those that were yong. And to iustifie that maruel
hee told her how her cosin the bastard did spend 4 or 5 houres in a day
to read vppon the same. Vpon which words by and by she conceyued the
cause of his deepe studie, and charged him to hide himselfe in some
place to mark what he did. Which commaundement the yeoman performed, and
perceiued that the booke which the bastard read vpon, was the window out
of which Rolandine talked with him: and therewithal called to
remembrance many wordes of the loue which they thought to keepe very
secreete. The next day he rehersed the same vnto his maistresse, who
sent for her cosin the bastard, and after many tales told him, she
forbad him to resort thither any more, and at night she gaue like
warning to Rolandine, threatninge her that if she continued in her fond
and foolish loue, she woulde tell the Queene the whole circumstaunce of
her lighte demeaner. Rolandine (nothing astonied with those woords) did
sweare that sith the time she was forbidden by her maistresse the
queene’s maiesty, she neuer spake vnto him: the troth whereof shee might
learne aswel of the gentlewomen her companions, as of other seruauntes
of the house: and touching the window whereof she spake, she boldly
aduouched that she neuer talked with the Bastard there. Who (poore
gentleman) fearing that his affayres would be reuealed, kept himselfe
farre out from daunger, and longe time after did not retourne to the
Courte. Howbeit, he wrote many times to Rolandine by such secret meanes
as for all the espiall that the Queene had put, there passed no weeke
but twise at least shee hearde newes from him: and when one meanes did
fayle hym, hee deuised another, and many tymes sent a litle Page clothed
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page124" id = "page124">124</a></span>
in colours (so&nbsp;often altered and chaunged as he was sent) who
staying at the gates when the Ladies passed by, delyuered his letters
priuelye in the middest of the prease. Vpon a time as the Queene for her
pleasure walked into the fieldes, one which knew the Page and had charge
to take hede vnto those doings, ranne after him: but the Page which was
a fine boye, doubtinge leaste hee should be searched, conueyed hym selfe
into a poore woman’s house, where spedelie he burnt his letters in the
fier, ouer whiche a potte was boyling with meate for her poore familie.
The gentleman that followed him stripped him naked and searched his
clothes, but when he sawe that he could finde nothing, he let him goe:
and when he was departed, the olde woman asked him wherefore he searched
the boye: who aunswered: “to finde letters which he thought he had about
him.” “Tush,” (quod she) “serch no more, for he hath hidden them very
well.” “I&nbsp;pray thee tell me,” (quod the Gentleman) “In what place:”
hoping to haue recouered the same. But when hee vnderstode that they
were throwen into the fire, he well perceiued that the boye was craftier
then him selfe. All whiche incontinently hee tolde the Queene,
notwithstanding from that time forthe, the bastard vsed no longer the
Page, but sent one other of his olde seruauntes, whom he faithfully
trusted, and he (forgetting feare of death which hee knewe well the
Queene threatned on them that had to doe in those affaires) tooke vpon
him to carie his maister’s letters to Rolandine. And when hee was entred
the Castell, hee wayted at a certen doore placed at the foote of a paire
of staiers, by whiche the ladies passed to and fro: where he had not
taried long, but a yeoman which at other times had sene him, knewe him
and thereof told the maister of the Queene’s house, who soudainly made
searche to apprehende him. The fellowe which was wise and politique,
seing that diuers loked vpon him a farre of, retourned towardes the wall
(as&nbsp;though he would haue made his water) tearing his letters in so
many small peces as he could doe for his life, and threw them behinde an
old gate: who had no soner done the facte, but hee was apprehended and
throughly searched, and when they could finde nothing about him, they
made him <ins class = "correction" title = "‘s’ missing">weare</ins>
whether he had brought any letters or not, vsing him
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page125" id = "page125">125</a></span>
partly by rigor, and somewhat by faire perswasion to make him confesse
the truthe: but neither through promise or threate, they could get any
thing at his handes. Report hereof was brought to the Queene, and one of
the companie gaue aduise that searche should be made behind the gate,
where he was taken: in which place they founde nothing but litle peces
of letters. Then they caused the kinge’s Confessor to be sent for, who
recouering the peces layd them vpon a table, and red the lettre
throughout, where the veritie of the mariage (so&nbsp;much dissembled)
was throughly discifered, for the bastard in those letters called her
nothing els but wife. The Queene not meaning to conceale the fault of
her kinswoman, (which she ought to haue done) fil into a great rage and
storme, commaunding that the poore man by al meanes possible should be
forced to confesse the true tenor of that letter, to thintent that the
same by his affirmacion might not be denied: but doe what they could,
they were not able to make him alter his former tale. They which had
commission to examine him, brought him to the Riuer side and did put him
into a sack, saying that he did lie before God and the Queene, and
against an approued trothe. He that had rather lose his life than accuse
his maister, prayed them to suffer him to haue a ghostly father that
like a Christian he might ende his life, and so entre the ioyes prepared
for all repentant sinners, and after that he had clered his conscience,
he said vnto them: “Maisters, tell my Lorde and maister the Bastarde,
that I recommend vnto him the poore estate of my poore wife and
children, trusting his honour will haue consideration of them for my
sake, for so mutch as with good and loyall harte, I&nbsp;doe imploye my
life for his honor and suretie: and with me doe what you list, for you
get nothing at my handes that shall redounde to his hurt and preiudice.”
Then to put him in greater feare, they bounde him within the sacke and
threwe him into the water, crying unto him, if thou wilt tell the trouth
thou shalt be saued: but they seing that he would make no aunswer drew
him out againe, making reporte to the Queene of his faith and
constancie. Who then sayd, that neither the king nor she were so happy
in seruauntes as the Bastarde was, that had not wherewith to recompence
such fidelitie. The Quene did
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page126" id = "page126">126</a></span>
what she coulde to get him from his seruice, but the poore fellowe would
in no wise forsake his maister. Notwithstanding in thende by his said
maister’s leaue, he was put into the Queene’s seruice, where he liued
many happy dayes. The Queene after she vnderstode by the bastarde’s
letters the trouth of the mariage, sent for Rolandine, and in great
rage, called her caitife and miserable wretche, in stede of cosin,
reciting vnto her the disparagement of her noble house, and the villanie
she had committed against the honorable race whereof she came, and
against the will of her which was her Queene, kinswoman and maistres, by
contracting mariage without the licence of the king and her. Rolandine
whiche of long time knewe the small devocion that her maistres bare vnto
her, vsed her with like affection: and bicause she was werie of the
Quene’s displeasure, thinking that her correction vttered in presence of
many proceded not of loue, but rather to make her ashamed, abandoned
feare, and conceiuing courage, when she sawe the Queene in her chiefest
rage, with gladsome and firme countenaunce answered her in this wise:
“Madame, if you cannot conceiue the malice of your owne harte,
I&nbsp;will set before your eyes the rancour and displeasure of the
same, which malice of long time you haue borne towardes the Lorde my
father and me: whereof madame, I&nbsp;doe fele the smarte, to my great
losse and grief: for if it had pleased you to haue borne vnto me that
good wil which you do to those that are not so nere about you as I am,
I&nbsp;had before this tyme been placed and preferred in mariage as well
to the likyng of your honour as to my greate satisfaction: but you haue
regarded mee as one forgotten, and cleane out of fauour, in such wyse as
all the noblemen, with whome I might haue been matched, haue contempned
me, as well through the negligence of my Lorde my father, as for the
like estimation and accompt that you haue made of me: by meanes whereof
I fell into that dispaire which if my health could haue susteined the
order and state of religion, I&nbsp;would willingly haue taken it vpon
me, to haue seuered my selfe from the continuall hatred and enuy which
your grace ful rigorously hath showen vnto me: and being in this
dispaire, I&nbsp;chaunced to finde out him, that is proceded of so noble
a house as my selfe. If the loue of twoo
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page127" id = "page127">127</a></span>
persones is to be regarded, that meane to accomplishe the holy state of
wedlock: for you knowe that his father in nobilitie farre excelled myne.
He hath of long time loued me, and made great sute vnto me, but you
madame, whiche neuer pardoned me for any small offence, ne yet praysed
anye good acte of myne (although you know by experience that I haue not
vsed to talke of matters of loue or other worldlie affaires, and that I
minded aboue all things to leade a more religious life then any other)
doe make it an hainous matter that I should talke with a Gentleman
(so&nbsp;infortunate as my selfe), by whose loue, I&nbsp;thought or
sought for nothing els but the ease and comfort of my minde. And seing
my selfe voyde and frustrate of mine expectation, I&nbsp;shall imploie
indeuour so well to seeke my rest and quiet, as you haue gone about to
dispoyle me of the same: and then will celebrate the mariage which is
already assured by promises and by a ring. Wherefore, madame,
I&nbsp;thinke that you doe me great wrong by terming me to be a wicked
woman, sithe that in so great and perfect amitie I might haue founde
occasion (if&nbsp;I would) to haue committed euills: but there was neuer
betwene him and me any priuie fact, other then that is honest, hoping
that God wil shewe me such fauour, as before the mariage be consumat,
I&nbsp;shall obtaine the fauour and good will of my Lorde my father:
wherby I do neither offende God, nor my conscience, for I haue taried
till the age of <span class = "smallroman">XXX.</span> yeares, to see
what you and my father would doe for me. I&nbsp;haue kept my selfe so
chast and honest, as no man liuing is able to laye the contrarie to my
charge. And with that reason wherewith God hath indued me, being olde
and voyde of hope, to finde a husbande agreable to my nobilitie,
I&nbsp;am determined to marie sutche a one as I like beste, not for the
pleasure or satisfaction of the eye (for you know he is not faire) nor
for lust of the flesh (for there hath bene no carnall fact committed) ne
yet for pryde and couetousnes (for he is but poore and of litle
estimation) but I haue a sincere respecte and pure regarde to his
vertue, honestie and good grace, for whiche the worlde doth geue him
praise, and the great loue also that he beareth me, maketh me hope to
finde with him great rest and quiet. And after I had deuised and
considered the good and euill that might insue by
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page128" id = "page128">128</a></span>
this my choise, I&nbsp;still persisted in that mind, and haue well wayed
and pondered the same these twoo yeares past, being throughly resolued
to waste and spende the rest of my dayes with him which I meane still
firmely to kepe in despite of all the tormentes and cruelties, that the
greatest enemies I haue, be able to make my poore bodie suffre, no not
death it selfe shall force me to refuse hym. Wherefore Madame,
I&nbsp;beseech you to accept this my reasonable excuse, whereunto your
self is nowe made priuie, and suffer me to liue in that peace, whiche I
hope for euer through him, in these mine elder to finde.” The Queene wel
marking her stout wordes and countenaunce, and knowing the same to be
very true, was not able to aunswere her againe with reason: but
continuing, her rebukes and taunting checkes began to waste, and at
length fell out into this rage: “Ah, presumptuous drabbe, and caitife
wretch, in stede of humbling thy selfe and repenting thine offence, thou
carpest boldly without dropping or sheading any teare, whereby thou
doest manifestly declare that stubbornes and hardnes of thy harte: but
if the king, and thy father, would follow mine aduise, they should put
thee into a place, where force should make thee to vse other language.”
“Madame,” said Rolandine, “because you haue accused me of bolde talke
and presumptous speache, I&nbsp;meane from henceforth to hold my peace,
except you geue me leaue to make mine aunswere.” And when she was
commaunded to tell forth her mynde, she said: “It is not my part,
Madame, boldly or without duetifull reuerence to speake before your
maiestie (whiche is my maistresse, and the greatest Princesse in
Christendome). The wordes which I haue said, be not spoken (Madame) of
presumption, but to declare that I haue none other aduocate to pleade
for me, but the trouth of my cause. And therefore am bolde without
blushing feare to disclose the same, hoping that if your grace did knowe
the secret concept of my poore faithfull harte, you woulde not iudge mee
to be that woman which you terme me to be. I&nbsp;doe not doubt that any
mortall creature vnderstanding my behauiour in those matters wherwith I
am charged, would blame me, for my liberall speache, sithe I am sure
that God and myne honor in no point I haue offended. The cause which
maketh me
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page129" id = "page129">129</a></span>
thus without feare to saye my minde is, because I am assured that he
whiche seeth my harte, is the geuer of my life also, and remaineth with
me. If then such a Iudge and Guide doe order and dispose my life, why
should I be afrayd of them that be subiect vnto his iudgement? And why
then Madame, should I wayle or wepe, sithe mine honor and conscience
without remorse or grudge do wel like of these my doings, which if they
were newly to begin, I&nbsp;would not repente me to doe the same againe.
But it is you (Madame) that hath good cause to wepe, as well for the
great displeasure, euer borne me from my youthfull dayes, as for the
wrong you doe me nowe by reprehending me before the face of all the
worlde for a faulte, whiche ought rather to be imputed vnto you then
vnto me. For if I had offended God, the king, or you, my parentes, or my
conscience, I&nbsp;were well worthy to be counted very obstinate, if
with great repentaunce I did not lament the same, but for a dede that is
right good and vertuous, I&nbsp;ought not to wepe, whereof there was
neuer other rumor spred but verie honorable, except the slaunder which
your selfe hath raised, whereby your desire to increase my shame and
dishonor appeareth to be greater then the respecte you haue to conserue
the nobilitie of your house, or kindred wherof you come. But because it
pleaseth you, Madame, so to vse me, I&nbsp;purpose not to withstand you.
For when you shall ordeine that punishment for me, which you like best,
I&nbsp;shal reioyse no lesse to suffer the same without desert, then you
be willing to bestowe it vpon me without cause. Wherefore Madame,
commaunde my Lorde my father to put me to what tormente you will, for
the execution wherof you shall not finde him vnwilling. And I shall not
be altogether without ioy, to see him prest and redie to obey your
wilfull mynde. But I haue a father in heauen, who (I&nbsp;am sure) will
geue me suche pacience, as I shall be able to abide and indure, what
affliction soeuer you prepare for me, in whom only is al my hope and
trust.” The Queene, so angrie as she could be, commaunded her out of her
sight, and to be shutte into a chamber alone, that none might speake
vnto her. In which imprisonment shee was not depriued from the companie
of her gouernesse, by whose meanes she let the Bastarde vnderstande all
her fortune, and she likewise
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page130" id = "page130">130</a></span>
vnderstode what he thought best for her to doe. Who thinking that the
seruice which he had done to the king, would stand him in some stede,
came vnto the Court with all spede, and founde the king in the fieldes,
to whome hee rehearsed the trouth of the facte, beseching his maiestie
that vnto him (who was a poore gentleman) he would shewe such fauour and
grace as the rigor of the Queene’s maiestie might be appeased, and the
mariage fully consumat and ended. The king made him none other aunswere,
but saide: “Is it true that thou hast maried her?” “Yea sir,” saide the
Bastarde: “by wordes only as yet: but if it please your maiestie, the
same may be throughly made perfit.” The king nodded his hed, and for
that time geuing him none other aunswere, hee retourned straite to the
Castell, and when he was almost there, he called the Captaine of his
Guarde, and commaunded him to apprehend the Bastarde. Notwithstanding
one of his frendes which knewe the kinge’s countenaunce, willed him to
absent himselfe, and to retire to one of his houses, and if the king
made serche after him (as&nbsp;he suspected) he would incontinently
aduertise him therof, that he might auoyde the realme: and when the
king’s displeasure was pacified, he would sende him worde. The Bastarde
beleued him, and vsed such diligence as the Captain of the Guarde could
not finde him. The king and the Queene councelled together what they
might doe with this poore damsell, whiche was their kinswoman, and by
the Queene’s aduise it was concluded, that she should be sent home to
her father, with the true aduertisement of the whole matter. But before
she was sent, diuerse Diuines and learned men of the Clergie, were
demaunded their opinions of the priuat mariage, and the Counsell also
did sit vpon the same, who concluded that for so muche as the mariage
was not celebrated but by wordes, it might easely be vndone, vntill one
of them had acquited the other. Which the king commaunded to be
performed for the honor of the house wherof she came. But she made them
aunswere, that in all thinges she was redie to obey the king, except it
were in matter against her conscience, sayinge, that those whome God had
coupled together by heauenly aduise, could not bee separated by man’s
decree, praying them not to attempt a thing so
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page131" id = "page131">131</a></span>
vnreasonable: for if loue and good will founded vpon the feare of God,
were the true and sure knot of mariage, then she was so wel bounde and
tied, as neither iron, fier, or water coulde breake that band, but death
alone. Wherunto, and to none other constitution, she was determined to
rendre her ring and othe, praying them not to speake, do, or proceede,
to any thing that were contrarie vnto that: wherin she was so stedfastly
resolued, as she had rather die by keping her faith, then liue to denie
the same. The Commissioners retorned to the king and Queene the constant
answere of the Gentlewoman, and when they sawe no remedie could be found
to make her renounce her husband, they conueyed her home to her father,
in such pitifull sorte, as by the way she passed, eche man and woman
lamented her fortune. And albeit shee had offended, yet the punishement
and affliction she suffred was so great and her constancie so firmely
bent, as she made her fault to be estemed a vertue. The father receiuing
those pitifull newes, would not see her, but sent her to his castell
that stoode in a forest, which he had before time builded for an
occasion, worthy to be rehersed hereafter, and there kept her in prison
a long time, sending worde vnto her, that if shee would forsake her
husband, he would take her for his doughter, and set her at libertie.
Who for all that offer was firme and constant, and loued her prison the
better by obseruing the bond of mariage, then al the libertie of the
world, without the hauing of her husband. And it semed by her
countenaunce, that al the paynes she had indured were most pleasaunt
pastimes, for that she suffred the same for his sake, whome she loued
best. What should I speake of men? This Bastarde at length became
vnmindeful of her, and fled into Alemaine, where he had many frendes.
Whose inconstancie afterwardes appeared so manifest, as the vertue of
true and perfit loue outwardly seming to remain in him, was conuerted
into the vice of odible ingratitude, whereby it was euident, that the
causes that made him so hotte a Suter, were the vglie monsters of
Auarice and Ambition, where he fill in loue with an Almaine Ladie, he
forgetting to visite her with letters, that for his sake had susteined
so great and manifold tribulations. For what rigor or affliction soeuer
Fortune offred, coulde neuer before that tyme put
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page132" id = "page132">132</a></span>
awaye the meanes from writing one to an other, but onely the vices
before named, and the foolish and wicked loue wherin he suffred him
selfe to fall. Which sudden and newe loue so perced the hart of
Rolandine, and so fiercely assailed the same, as she could no more
content and rest her self. Afterwards vpon the viewe of his wrytinges
and letters, seing him to be so chaunged and altered from his accustomed
stile, what tormentes then she suffred, they doe knowe that haue felte
and tasted the bitter cup of like passions. And yet her perfecte loue
would not suffer her to fixe certaine iudgement vpon this aduertisement,
and therefore deuised secretly to sende one of her seruaunts whome shee
trusted best, to espie, and priuely make serche whether the same were
true or not. Whiche her seruaunt being retourned, hee truely tolde her,
howe the Bastarde Gentleman was in loue with a Ladie of Almaine, and
howe the brute was that he made great sute vnto her for mariage, because
shee was very ritche. These newes brought sutche extreme sorrowe and
grief to the harte of poore Rolandine, as being not able to abide the
bruntes thereof, she fill very sicke. Those whiche vnderstode the
originall of her disease, sayde vnto her (in&nbsp;the behalfe of her
father) that for so muche as nowe she knewe the great villanie of the
Bastarde, shee might iustly forsake hym: persuading her thereunto with
the greatest reasons they could deuise. But for all those persuasions,
no remedie could be founde to make her chaunge opinion: in whiche her
laste tentacion shee declared the great constancie wherewith she was
affected: for like as loue was decreased in him: so the same augmented
in her, whiche remained and persisted in despite of all the malice of
the worlde. For that loue, whiche fayled, and was fledde from him,
tourned and retired into her. And when she perceiued her selfe alone
fully possessed with that whiche before was deuided betwene them bothe,
shee determined to obserue the same vntill death had made an ende of her
fatall dayes. Wherefore the goodnes of God (which is perfect charitie
and true loue) had pitie vpon her sorrowe, and regarded her pacience in
such wise, as within few daies after the Bastarde died in the pursute of
the other ladie’s Loue. Wherof Rolandine being <ins class = "correction"
title = "error for ‘aduertised’">dauertised</ins> by those which saw him
buried, prayed them to trauell
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page133" id = "page133">133</a></span>
with her father by humble sute, that he would vouchsafe to giue her
leaue to speake vnto him. Who at their request, (although he neuer spake
vnto her before, during the tyme of her imprisonment) incontinently was
pleased so to doe. And after that he had herde the discourse of her
iuste reasons, in place of rebukes, and his promise made to kill her
(which many times he threatened by woordes) he cleped her betweene his
armes, and bitterly weping, sayde vnto her: “Daughter, I&nbsp;wel
perceiue your vertue and constant mynde, which farre surmounteth any
thing that is good in mee, for if there be any faulte or lacke of
consideration of your estate, I&nbsp;am the principal occasion thereof:
but sith the goodnes of God hath thus ordeined it, I&nbsp;wil make
satisfaction for mine offence past.” And afterwardes he sent her home to
his house, where he vsed and interteigned her like his derest and eldest
daughter. In the ende she was demaunded in mariage by a Gentleman of
name and armes, to her estate and bloud not inferior. Who was bothe wise
and vertuous, and so louingly regarded Rolandine (whome he many times
visited) as he attributed vnto her the prise of prayse for that, which
others accompted worthy of rebuke, knowing that her intent of former
loue was grounded vpon the foundation of vertue. The mariage was well
liked of her father, was acceptable to Rolandine, and was forthwith
concluded. True it is that a brother she had, the only inheritour of her
father’s landes, who would not agree that she should receiue her
childe’s porcion, obiecting that she had disobeied her father. And after
the death of the good old man (her father) her brother vsed her very
rigorously and cruelly. For her husbande was but a yonger brother, and
had wherewithal scarce able to liue: for which want, God bountifully
prouided: for the brother whose gredie minde did craue in one daie to be
possessor of al, by sodain death was depriued, as well of his sister’s
porcion as of al the rest. By whose death she remained the whole
inheritor of that honorable house: and afterwardes liued an honorable
and stately life, in great wealth and pleasure, and was welbeloued and
duetifully intreated of her husband. Finally hauing by her husband two
goodly sonnes, she very vertuously brought them vp, and finishing her
aged dayes, she ioyfully rendred her soule vnto him,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page134" id = "page134">134</a></span>
in whom of long time she had reposed her onely trust and confidence. Now
good ladies let them come forth that be the common displaiers of women’s
inconstancie, and let them bring forth in presence, so good and perfect
a husband as this was a good and constant woman, indued with semblable
faith and vertue. I&nbsp;am sure to bring this to passe the matter wilbe
very difficult: and therfore I had rather discharge them of this my
chalenge, then put them to payne to trauell and seeke for such a one.
Whose vertuous loue and godlye continuance of the same, is worthye to
bee sounded by Trompe of fame to the extreame partes of the Earth. And
yet I would aduise yonge Ladies and gentlewomen to beware how they be
inamoured, and pursue the trade of loue, contrarie to the will of
parentes, who ought in time of infancie to be their guide, and also in
riper yeares to procure them mariage according to their worthines: which
they may the better and soner do, is by vertuous education they arme and
instruct their tender and youthly age.</p>

The Wisedome of a woman to withdrawe the foolishe loue of her husband,

<p><span class = "firstword">Many</span> yeares are not yet expired
sithens there was a Gentlewoman of noble house (whose name I may not
disclose), so wise and vertuous as shee was wel beloued and esteemed of
her neighbours: her husband (not without good cause) trusted her in al
his affaires, which she ordred and gouerned so wisely, as her house by
her meanes grew to be one of the richest and best apparelled, that was
in the countrie wherein she dwelled. Liuing thus a long time with her
husbande, by whom shee had many goodly children, their happie state and
felicitie (after which daily insue their contraries) began to decaie,
because that he, defatigated with to much quiet, abandoned restfull
life, to seeke after troublesom trauell: and had gotten a custome when
his wife was a sleepe to rise from her side, and not to returne vntill
it was very nere morning. The gentlewoman misliking this maner of life,
became very ielous of her husband, and yet made as though she mistrusted
nothing: but that spitefull passion entred her stomacke so farre, as in
thende shee forgot thaffayres of her house, the diligence of her person,
and good gouernment of her familie, like vnto one that verely supposed
that (do&nbsp;what shee could) she had lost the fruite of her paine and
labour, which was the great loue of her husband, for continuance whereof
shee spared no trauaile or toile: but losinge altogether as shee
manifestly perceiued, shee grew to be so carelesse of her housholde
state and houswiferie, as speedelie appeared the fruites of slouth and
negligence: for her husband for his part spent without order, and she
staied her trauell from matters of houshold: in such wise as the same
was growen to so great penurie, as the high and stately woodes were
felled downe to the stubbe, and the goodly maners deliuered into the
handes of sir Mathewe Morgage. One of the gentlewoman’s frendes and
kinsemen which knew her disease, tolde her of her fault, and rebuked her
for that carelesse life: sayinge, that if loue
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page136" id = "page136">136</a></span>
of husband could not make her to haue respecte of housholde profite:
zeale and regarde of poore children’s state ought to moue her thereunto.
This good councell of her frende touched her very nere, and the pitie of
her children at lengthe made her to recouer her spirits, and to assaie
by all meanes possible to wynne againe her husbande’s loue. See here the
nature of honestie, and condicion of well disposed life: this
gentlewoman was infected with the plague of Ielousie (an&nbsp;ordinarie
disease in women,) and not without iust cause: for what Grisilde could
suffre her wedded husband, assembled in bedde, in depthe of slepe, to
rise and runne a straie like a wylde horse, neying after the straied
female kinde of that sorte? This good Gentlewoman, I&nbsp;saye, almoste
besides her wittes for alienation of her deserued loue, now growen
careles of worldly thinges, as you haue heard, is vpon the louing
admonicion of her nerest frend, pricked with naturall regarde of
Infantes: launching forth that festred sore of Ialousie, serched meanes
by policie to wynne that which Ialousie could not get, whiche was her
husbande’s loue, whom with curteouse wiuely shame not before assemblie
of neighbours, or straungers audience, by huy and crye as many doe, but
in domesticall boundes, within the compas of housholde, and within the
circuit of secret chambre, shee made him blushe from former life, and to
deteste all filthie and beastly factes in future time. Suche be the
frutes of a right matrone’s life. Suche be the gaines of the milde and
quiet wife. Such a wife, I&nbsp;say, is the honor of her husband’s name,
the onely vpholder and restoratife of his renowme and fame. But turne we
againe to the experienced wisedome of this Gentlewoman. The next day she
diligently watched by false slepe, the time of his vprising from her:
and when he was gone, shee rose likewyse, putting her night gowne about
her, causing the bedde to bee made, and saying her prayers, she waited
the retourne of her husband, who being retired into his chambre, she
came before him to kisse hym, and brought him a basen with water to
washe his handes: and musing at the vnaccustomed order of his wife, he
tolde her that he was come but from the priuie, and therfore neded not
to washe. Whereunto she answered, that although it were no great matter,
yet cleanly and honest, to washe the handes, being come
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page137" id = "page137">137</a></span>
from an vncleane and stinking place, by which wordes she was desirous to
let him vnderstande his follie thereby to hate his dishonest and filthie
life. But for all that wyse and pretie taunte hee amended nothing at
all: Howbeit she continued that ordre the space of one yere. And when
she sawe, that her diligence could not reforme his vsuall trade of lyfe,
on a tyme wayting for her husband, which taried longer then he was wont
to doe, shee was desirous to seeke hym out, and went from chamber to
chamber, till at lengthe shee founde hym a bedde in a back chambre and a
sleepe with the moste ill fauoured, foule and filthiest Slutte of her
house, such a homely pece and durty beaste, as the lyke was not to be
founde in a countrie. The gentlewoman beholding this manerly sight,
thought to teache him a lesson howe to remembre the difference betwene
the sweete and pleasaunt lodging, with a fayre and duetifull wife, and
the vncleanly couching with a stinking and lothsome Queane. Wherupon she
caused a burden of Strawe and worne rushes to be brought vnto her,
setting the same on fier in the middes of the chamber, but when she sawe
her husband almoste choked with the great smother, she waked hym, and
plucked him out of the bed by the armes, crying: “fier, fier.” If the
husbande were ashamed, and offended with him selfe to be founde in a
bedde with such an vncleanly matche, by his faire and honest wife,
I&nbsp;referre the iudgement to all indifferent men, that be coupled
with like wiues. Then his wyfe said vnto him: “Sir I haue assaied the
space of one whole yeare, to withdrawe you from this vile and wicked
life, by gentlenes and pacience, and shewed example by washing you
without, that you might also clense your selfe within. But when I sawe
myne endeuour could take no place, I&nbsp;attempted to helpe my selfe
with the element that shall ende and consume vs all: assuring you, sir,
that if this doe not amende you, I&nbsp;cannot tell if the seconde time,
I&nbsp;be able likewise to ridde you from the daunger that may happen.
I&nbsp;praye you sir to thinke and consider that there is no greater
dispayre or dispite, then that whiche is conceiued of loue: and had I
not set before mine eyes the feare of God, I&nbsp;could not haue
practised suche pacience, as I haue done.” The husband very glad, that
he had escaped that misfortune, promised her neuer to geue occasion,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page138" id = "page138">138</a></span>
that shee should take like payne to bring him to order. Whiche promise
the Gentlewoman very willingly beleued, and with her husbande’s consent,
she expelled out of her house, that which did displease her moste: and
from that time forth, they louingly liued together, and the former
faultes of this reformed life, was an increase of ioyful and mutuall
delightes. I&nbsp;beseche you Gentlewomen (if&nbsp;there be any in the
place where this nouell is redde) if God doe geue you such husbandes to
beware of dispaire, vntill ye haue assayed all possible meanes to reduce
them to good ordre. For there be in the daye <span class =
"smallroman">XXIIII.</span> houres, in euery of whiche houres a man may
chaunge opinion: and a woman ought to accompt her selfe moste happie, if
by pacience and long suffraunce she wynne her husbande, excepte fortune
and frendes haue procured one that is alreadie perfecte. This example
therefore maye serue al sortes of maried women. Let her take example
that list (quod Dame Partelot) for it is impossible for me to vse suche
long pacience. But let Dame Partelot speake her pleasure, I&nbsp;would
aduise all husbandes to lyue honestly with their honest wiues, and doe
praie to God to plant mo sutch wiues to store the barren worlde that
neuer or seldome bryngeth forth such increase.</p>

The notable charitie of a woman of Tours towards her husbande.</p>


<p><span class = "firstword">Another</span> hystorie of like example I
thincke meete to bee annexed: which telleth howe in the Cittie of Tours
in Fraunce, there was a fayre and honest wyfe which for her vertues was
not onelye beloued, but also feared and esteemed of her husband. So it
was that he followinge the fragilitie of those men, which be wearie of
delicate fare, fill in loue with a woman of the Countrye that kepte his
house there, and many times departed from Tours to visite his countrie
woman, where he commonlye taried <span class = "smallroman">II.</span>
or <span class = "smallroman">III.</span> dayes before his retorne: and
when he came home againe to Tours, he ordinarely did take cold, whereof
his good wife had much to do to recouer him. And so sone as he was hole,
hee failed not to returne to the place, where pleasure made him forget
all his former griefe and sicknes. His wife which aboue all thinges
loued his life and tendred his health, seinge him commonly broughte into
so poore estate, went into the Countrye, where she founde out the yong
woman that her husband loued. Vnto whom (not in choler but with smilinge
cheere and countenaunce) shee sayd: “How she knew well that oftentimes
her husband repaired thither to visite her, and that she was not well
content that she vsed him no more carefully, for when he came home from
her he toke so great cold as long time after she had much a doe to
recouer him.” The poore woman as wel for the reuerence of the Dame, as
for the trouth of the matter, could not denie the facte, and therefore
fallinge downe vppon her knees, asked her forgiuenes. The maistresse
required to see the bedde and chamber, where her husband laie, which she
perceiued to be so cold, ill fauoured, and out of order, as she pitied
and lamented the case: wherefore incontinently she sent for a good bedde
furnished with sheetes, blanquets and Couerlet, accordingly as she knew
her husband loued, causing the chamber to be repaired, hanged, and
dressed vp, after the best maner: she gaue her also plate and vessell to
serue her husband at meales, together with a punchion of wyne, spice,
and other
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page140" id = "page140">140</a></span>
confections: and then prayed the woman to sende home her husbande, no
more so sicke, but to interteigne and cherishe him after the most
delicate and carefull maner she could. The husband taried not long at
home, but after his olde custome wente againe into the countrie to visit
his woman, and marueiled much to finde her poore lodging so trimlye
garnished, but much more he wondred when calling for drincke he sawe her
to bringe him a siluer potte, asking her where she had gotten all those
goodes. The poore woman sayde vnto him weeping, that it was his wife,
which hauing so great pitie vppon his ill intreatie, had furnished her
house, and had committed vnto her the charge and regard of his health.
Hee seing the greate humilitie and goodnes of his wyfe, and that shee
for the vnkindnes he shewed vnto her, had requited him with that
curtesie and louing kindnes, well pondering and regarding his owne
frailtie, and the honeste demeanor of his wyfe, afterwards rewarded the
poore woman with money, and perswaded her from that time foorth to liue
an honest life. And then returned home to his wyfe, confessing vnto her
the negligence of his dutie, and that excepte she had vsed that kinde of
curtesie and goodnes towards him, it had bin impossible for him to
forsake and giue ouer his vngodlye life: and afterwardes vtterly
abandoning his behauiour past, they liued together in great rest and
quietnes. Belieue me if ye list (to&nbsp;you good wiues I speake) that
there be verye few ill husbands, whom the pacience and loue of the wyfe,
is able at lengthe to winne, or els they be more harde then stones,
which the soft and feble water by continuance of time, is able to weare
and make holow: for when the wiue’s lenitie shall enter his carelesse
stomacke, and her pacient suffraunce renew remembraunce of dutie, then
doth conscience bite, and gnaw the cancred cord that tyeth vp the good
consideracion of his office, and regarde to maried life: then doth age
abhorre the lewdnes of former life, and commeth home to cherish the
holsome Nourice of his pleasant state. Then regardeth he the bande
wherewith matrimonie hath bound him, and both at bedde and borde
obserueth the ful perfections of the same.</p>

stone, erected for great personages, with pictures liuely wroughte, and
about the same Tombe there doe lie manye worthie knightes of great fame

<p><span class = "firstword">To</span> conclude our nomber of Nouels, I
haue thought good (gentle reader) to bringe in place a Doctour and his
wyfe, to giue thee a merye farewell: because thou haste hitherto so
frendly and pacientlye suffred thy selfe to be stayed in reading of the
reste: wherefore with a pleasaunt Adieu in a short and merie tale, which
discloseth the subtiltie of two false knaues to beguile a poore Doctor
and his wyfe, I&nbsp;meane to end. And therfore do saye, that in the
Citie of Bologna in Italie, there was a worshipful Doctor of the Lawes,
called Maister Florien, which in other thinges sauing his profession was
but a slouen, and of so ill behauiour as none of his facultie the like:
who by sauing of many crustes, had layed vp so good store of Crownes, as
he caused to be made a very great and costly Cup of siluer, for payment
of which Cup he went to the Goldsmithe’s house, and hauinge payed for
the siluer, the guilt, and for the fashion, being without his Clarke to
carie it home, he prayed the Goldsmith to lend him his man. By chaunce
there were newly come to the Citie, two yonge men that were Romaynes,
which ranged vp and downe the streates with eares vpright, to view and
marke euery thinge done in the same, bearing about them counterfait
Iewels and lingots, guilt of S.&nbsp;Martine’s touche, to deceiue him
that would playe the foole to buy them. One of them was called Liello
and the other Dietiquo. These two Marchantes being at good leasure to
wander the streates, beholding the passangers to and fro, by fortune
espied the Goldsmithe’s man, who (to&nbsp;set forth the workemanship and
making of the cup) caried the same open. These gallants bearing a spite
to the cup, more for the siluer than for other malice, purposed to
inuent some sleight to get the Cuppe, and a farre of with slie pase,
followed the Goldsmithe’s man, of whom they craftelie inquired of the
owner of the Cup, and where hee had left maister Florien. When they had
concluded vppon their enterprise, Liello (the finest boye of
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page143" id = "page143">143</a></span>
them both) went straight to buy a Lamprey of great price, and hiding the
same vnder his cloake, repayred directly to Maister Doctour’s house,
where finding his wife of semblable wit and behauiour that her husband
was, with vnshamefast face and like grace, said vnto her: “Maistresse,
Maister Florien your husbande hath sent you a fishe, and prayeth you to
dresse it and to make dinner readie, because he bringeth a company of
other Doctoures with him: in the meane time he requireth you, to retorne
vnto him the Cuppe againe, whiche hee sent you this morning by the
Goldsmithe’s man, because he had forgotten to stampe his armes vppon
it.” The woman receyuinge the fishe, franckly deliuered him the Cup, and
went about to prepare dinner. Liello (which hunted after gaine but
better caught his prey) hied him a pace and conueyed himselfe with
speede to the house of one of his Countriemen, and there reioyced with
his companion, attending for the comming of the Royster Dietiquo, who
taried in the Towne, wayting and viewing what pursute was made after his
fellowe. Sone after maister Florien retourned to his house and finding
his dinner more delicate than it was wont to be, marueyled, and asked
his wyfe who was at all that coste. His wyfe very scornefully aunswered:
“Why sir, haue you forgotten that you sente me word this morning that
you woulde bring home with you diuers Gentlemen to dinner?” “What”
(quoth the Doctour) “I&nbsp;thincke you be a foole.” “I&nbsp;am not”
(sayd shee) “and for better witnesse you sent mee this fishe, that I
would you had been better aduised before you had bestowed such coste.”
“I&nbsp;assure thee:” quoth hee, “I&nbsp;sent thee no fishe, but belike
it was some folishe knaue that had forgotten his arrant and mistaken the
house: but howsoeuer it was wyse, we at this time will be content to
fare well, at other mennes charge.” “Why sir (sayd his wyfe) call your
selfe to better remembraunce, for hee that brought the Lampry, came to
me for your Cup, by this token that you would haue your armes engrauen
vppon the same.” At those words the poore Doctour, after he had
discharged three or foure Canons laden with haile shot of scolding words
wente out into the streate, running hither and thither demaunding of al
them he met, if they saw none carrie a Lampry home to his house. And you
would haue said if you

had seen the Doctour wyth his hode hanging at one side, that he had been
out of his wittes. Dietiquo stode still in a corner, and beheld the
Doctour’s frantike order, and albeit that he was sure the stealinge of
the Cuppe by Liello his companion was impossible to be knowen, yet being
sorye that the Lampry cost so much, determined also to play his part,
and seinge the doctour stayed from making further complaintes and
pursute, he went home to the Doctour’s house, where smiling with a good
grace and bould countenaunce saide vnto his wyfe: “Maistresse Doctour,
good newes, the Cup is founde, one whom you know caused the same to be
done in sport to bring your husband Maister Florien in a choler, who now
is amonges diuers of his frendes iesting at the pleasuant deceipt, and
hath sent me hither to fetch their dinner, wherein they praye you to
remember the Lamprey, and to come your selfe to take part of the same,
bicause they purpose to be mery.” The woman ioyful of those newes, began
some what to complaine of the griefe which she had taken for losse of
the cup, and deliuered to Dietiquo the rosted Lamprey with the sause,
betwene two platters who incontinently hid the same vnder his cloke, and
wyth so much speede as he could, went to seeke out his companion Lielo,
and their countrimen, which all that while had taried for him: and God
knoweth whether those good fellowes did laugh and mocke the poore
Doctour, and his wife or not, and when she had made herself gay and
trimme to go eate part of the Lamprey, as she was going out she met
Maister Florien lookinge lowringlie vppon the matter, to whom she said
(smiling like a frumenty pot) “How now, sir, come they hither to dinner?
I&nbsp;haue sent you that Lamprey ready dressed.” Then Maister Doctor
after faire talke, beganne to discharge his double Cannons, callinge his
wyfe Whore, bitch, and beaste, and vnderstandinge that he was twice
begiled and could not tell by whom, for spite and despayre he tare of
his beard, and the heare of his head, which bruted and knowen in the
Citie, the Iesters and pleasaunt felowes bent themselues to laugh, and
deuise pastime at the poore begiled Doctour and his wyfe.</p>

the Science of that surpassing and delightsome pasture of Theologie, is

consolation, we may conceiue hope of Eternitye. The knowledge of
Philosophie cureth the Mynde, auoydeth childish care, expelleth feare,
and shunneth fond desyres. O&nbsp;Philosophye, the guide of life,
(exclameth Tullie) the inquisitor of Vertue and expeller of vice.
Rethorike (affirmeth&nbsp;he) causeth vs to learne that we know not and
that we know to teach to other: by the same we exhort, with that we
perswade, with that we comfort the afflicted, by it we encourage the
astonned, and appease the outragious. Musike, easeth the troubled mynde,
lenifyeth sorrowe, comforteth the heauye harted, and erecteth a
contemplatyon of heauenlye thinges. Astronomye, reuealeth the nature of
the Starres and Planets, presageth dayes and times for the helpe and
maintenaunce of life. Poesie teacheth amendment of manners, directeth
what things be mete for imitation, and with what detriment wantonnes

so necessary, as the same taken away, reason is depriued and the Life of
Man (of&nbsp;due order and gouernment) defrauded. Thinke (sayth a Greke
Oratour) the knowledge of many thinges to bee more precious and
excellent, then a Chest heaped vp with abundance of money: for the one
quickly fayleth, and the other for euer lasteth. For Scientia (affirmeth
hee) is the onelye immortall storehouse of all possessions. Amonges
which troupe of Sciences, the knowledge and search of Histories
deserueth a place in the chefest rank, and is for example of humaine
affayres, a&nbsp;Christal light to shew the pathes of our Auncestors.
The same displaieth the counsels, aduises, pollicies, actes, successe,
and endes of Kinges, Princes and great men, with the order and
discription of time and place. And like a liuely image representeth
before our eies the beginning, end and circumstaunce of ech attempt. The
same (like a Mistresse of our life) by probable examples stirreth vp our
sluggish mindes, to aspyre the eternal glorie of praise and fame, and
terrifyeth the desperate and aduenturous, from enterprise of things
vnseemely. The same is a passing picture of verity, and an absolute

am not ignorant what Encomia innumerable Authors in time past, and
wryters of our tyme do attribute vnto that science, and with what titles
the Prince of them all decketh the praise of Historicall knowledge,
I&nbsp;only refer the worthines to the practisers, and the syngularitye

Scipio to bee true: that he was neuer lesse idle, then when he was idle,
and neuer lesse alone, then when he was alone, meaning therby, that when
he was at best leisure, he was neuer idle, nor when he was alone
vnoccupied. For when labor resteth him selfe in me, and leisure

finally of your modest and curteous dealings in that office,
I&nbsp;feare lacke of ability (and not of matter) would want grace and

THE FIRST NOUELL.</a></h3>

<p class = "summary">
The hardinesse and conquests of diuers stout, and aduenturous women,
called Amazones, the beginninge, and continuance of their Reigne, and of
the great iourney of one of their Queenes called Thalestris to visit
Alexander the great: with the cause of her trauaile.</p>


<p><span class = "firstletter">W</span>here the firste booke beegan with
a Combate fought, and tried betweene two mighty Citties, for
Principality, and Gouernement, the one hight Rome after called the head
of the World (as&nbsp;some thinke by reason of a man’s head found in the
place where the Capitole did stand) the other Alba. To which Combat sixe
Gentlemen of eyther city were appoyncted, and the victory chaunced to
the Romayne side: In this second parte, in the Forefront, and first
Nouell of the same, is described the beginninge, continuaunce and ende
of a Woman’s Common wealth (an&nbsp;History rare and straunge to the
vnlearned, ignorant of the world’s fickle ruled stay) which contented
with the mighty Princes and puissant Potentates for defence of their
kingdome, no lesse than the Carthaginians and Romaynes did for theirs.
But as it is no wonder to the skilful that a whole Monarche, and
kingdome should be intierly peopled with that Sexe: so to the not well
trained in Histories, this may seeme miraculous. Wherefore not to staye
thee from the discourse of those straunge and Aduenturous women, diuers
be of diuers opinions for the Etimologie of the word: whereof amonges
the Grætians be diuers iudgementes. These Amazones were most excellent
warriers, very valiaunt, and without man’s aduice did conquer mighty
Countreyes,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page160" id = "page160">160</a></span>
famous Cities, and notable Kingdomes, continuinge of longe time in one
Seigniory, and gouernment. These people occupied and enioyed a great
part of Asia. Som writers deuide them into two Prouinces, one in Scythia
in the North part of Asia: other by the hill Imaus, which at this day is
called the Tartarian Scythia, different from that which is in Europa:
the other sort of the Amazones were in Libia a prouince of Africa. But
because the common sort of Authors doe vnderstand the Amazones to be
those of Asia, I&nbsp;meane to leaue of the difference. The Scythians
were a warlike people, and at the beginninge of their kingdome had two
kinges, by whom they were gouerned. Notwithstandinge the nature of
dominion beinge of it selfe ambicious, cannot abide any companion or
equall: which caused these two kinges to be at variaunce, and afterwards
the matter grew to ciuill warres, wherein the one beinge Victor, two of
the principal and chiefe of the contrary faction, called Plinius and
Scolopithos, were banished with a great number of their adherentes, al
which did withdraw themselues to the limits of Cappadocia in the lesser
Asia, and in despite of the Countrey Pesantes, dwelled alonges the riuer
of Thermodon, which entreth into the Sea Euxinum, otherwise called
Pontus. And they beinge made Lordes of the countrey, and of the places
adioyninge, raygned for certayne yeares, vntill the Peasantes and their
confederates made a conspiracy agaynst them: and assemblinge by Pollicy,
ouercame and sleewe theym all. The newes of theyr death knowen to their
Wyues dwellinge in theyr countrey, caused them to conceiue great
heauinesse, and dolor extreme: and although they were women, yet did
they put on manly courage, and determined to reuenge the death of their
husbandes, by puttinge theyr hands to weapons wherewithal they did
exercise themselues very ofte: and that they might all be equall, and
their sorrow common, they murdred certaine of their husbandes which
remayned there, after the other were banished. Afterward beinge
altogether, they made a great army, and forsooke their dwellinge places,
refusinge the mariage of many suters: and arriuinge in the lande of
their enemies (that made small accoumpt thereof, although foretolde of
their approche) they sodaynly came vpon them vnprouided, and put them
all to the sword. This beinge done, the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page161" id = "page161">161</a></span>
women tooke the gouernment of the Countrey, inhabitinge at the
beginninge alonge the Riuer of Thermodon, where their husbandes were
slayne. And although many Authors do differ in the situation of the
place where the Amazones did dwell, yet the truth is, that the beginning
of their kingdome and of their Habitation was vppon that Riuer. But of
their manyfolde conquestes, be engendred diuers opinions declared by
Strabo, and others. They fortified themselues in those places, and wan
other countreys adioyninge, choosinge amonge them two Queenes, the one
named Martesia, and the other Lampedo. These two louingely deuided the
army and men of Warre in two partes, eyther of them defendinge (with
great hardinesse) the Landes which they had conquered: and to make
themselues more dreadfull (sutch was the credite and vanity of men that
time) they fayned to be the daughters of Mars. Afterward these
miraculous women liuing after this maner in peace and iustice,
considered that by succession of time, for want of daughters that might
succeede, warres, and time, would extinguish their race. For thys cause
they treated maryage with their neyghbors named Gargarians
(as&nbsp;Plinie sayeth) with condition, that vpon certayne tymes of the
yeare, their husbandes should assemble together in some appoincted
place, and vse them for certaine dayes vntyll they were with chylde,
whych beinge done and knowen, they should returne home agayne to their
own houses. If they brought forth daughters, they norished and trayned
them vp in armes, and other manlik exercises, and to ride great Horse:
they taught them to run at Base, and to followe the Chace. If they were
deliuered of males, they sent them to their fathers, and if by chaunce
they kept any backe, they murdred them, or else brake their armes and
legs in sutch wise as they had no power to beare weapons, and serued for
nothynge else but to spin, twist, and to doe other feminine labour. And
for as mutch as these Amazones defended themselues so valiantly in the
Warres with Bowe, and Arrowes, and perceyued that their breastes did
very much impech the vse of that weapon, and other exercises of armes,
they seared vp the right breasts of their yonge daughters, for which
cause they were named Amazones, which signifieth in the Greeke tongue,
wythout breasts, although some other do geeue vnto that
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page162" id = "page162">162</a></span>
name any other meaninge. Afterwards, increasing by course of time in
number and force, they made greate preparation of Weapons and other
Engins for the Warres, and leauing their countrey (which they thought
was very small) in the keepinge of some, whom they specially trusted,
the rest marched abroade, conqueringe and subduinge all those which they
found rebellious. And hauing passed the river of Tanais, they entred
Europa, where they vanquished many countreys, directing their way
towardes Thracia, from whence they returned a while after, with great
spoyle and victory, and comminge agayne into Asia, they brought many
prouinces vnder their subiection, proceedinge euen to Mare Caspium. They
Edified, and peopled an infinite number of good citties, amongs which,
according to the opinion of diuers, was the famous Citty of Ephesus, the
same beeinge the chiefe of al their Empire, and the principal place that
stoode vpon Thermodon. They defended themselues in Warres with certayne
Tergats, made in fashion of a halfe Moone, and entring into battaile
vsed a certaine kinde of Flutes to geue the people corage to fight, as
the Lacedemonians were wont to do. In this wise increased more and more
the fame of those women, and so continued vntill the tyme that Hercules,
Theseus, and many other valiaunt men liued in Græcia. The sayd Hercules,
kinge Euristeus of Athenes commaunded, to proceede with great force of
people against the Amazones, and that hee should bringe vnto him the
armures of the two Queenes, which then were two sisters, that is to say
Antiopa and Oritia. At this commaundement Hercules incoraged with desire
of honor and glory, accompanied with Theseus, and other his frends,
sayled alongst Pontus, and arriued in most conuenient place vpon the
shoare of Thermodon, where he landed in sutch secret manner and with
sutch oportunity of tyme, as Oritia, one of the two Queenes was gone out
of the countrey with the greatest part of her women, to make Warre, and
conquer new Countreyes, in so mutch that he found Antiopa, which doubted
nothinge, ne yet knewe of his comminge. Vppon which occasion, Hercules
and his people surprisinge the Amazones vnwares, and although they
entred into Fielde and did put themselues in defence with sutch
diligence as they could, yet they
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page163" id = "page163">163</a></span>
were ouercome, and put theym to flight, and many of them slayne and the
rest taken: amongst whom were the two sisters of the Queene, the one
named Menalipe whych was Hercules prysoner, and the other Hipolita, the
prysoner of Theseus. Certane Historians do say that they were subdued in
a pitched field, and appoynted battle. And that afterwards the two
sisters were vanquished in singuler Combat. The Queene Antiopa then
seeinge this ouerthrow, and the takinge of her sisters, came to
composition with Hercules, to whom shee gaue her armure to cary to
Euristeus, vpon charge that he shoulde render vnto her, her sister
Menalipe. But Theseus for no offer that she coulde make, woulde deliuer
Hipolita, with whom he was so farre in loue, that he caried her home
with him, and afterward toke her to wyfe, of whom hee had a sonne called
Hipolitus. Hercules satisefied of his purpose, returned very ioyful of
his victory. Oritia certified of these news, beinge then out of her
countrey, conceyued no lesse shame than sorrow, who fearing greater
damage, returned speedily with her women, the greater part whereof
beinge of her opinion, perswaded Antiopa to be reuenged vpon the Grekes.
For which purpose they made great preparation of warre. Afterwards
leuyinge so great a number of the Amazones as they could, they sent to
Sigilus king of Scythia for succour: who sent them his sonne Pisagoras,
with a great number of horsemen, by whose helpe the Amazones passing
into Europa, and Countrey about Athenes, they greatly annoyed their
ennemy: but Pisagoras entred in quarel agaynst the Queene and her women,
by meanes whereof, the Scythians could not fight, but withdrew
themselues aside, whereby the Amazones (not able to support the force of
the Greekes,) were ouercome, and the greatest part of them cut in
peeces. Those which did escape, ran to the Scythians Campe, of whom they
were defended: afterward being returned into their countrey, they liued
in lesse force, and surety than before. In processe of time the Greekes
passed into Asia, and made a famous conquest of the Citty of Troy, when
Penthesilea was Queene of the Amazones, who remembringe the iniuries
receyued by the Greekes, went with a great army to helpe the Troians:
where the Queene did thinges worthy of remembraunce, but the Troianes

were almost slayne. And Penthesilea amonges other, was killed by the
hand of Achilles. Wherefore those that remained, returned into their
countrey with so litle power (in&nbsp;respect of that they had before)
as with great difficulty they susteyned, and defended their old
possessions, and so continued till the time that Alexander the great
went into Asia, to make warre against the Hircanians. In which time one
of their Queenes named Thalestris accompanied with a great number of the
Amazones, went out of hir countrey with great desire to see and know
Alexander. And approchinge the place where hee was, shee sent her
Ambassadour vnto him to the ende that shee might obtayne safe conduct to
see him, makinge him to vnderstand how mutch the Renoume of his
personage had inflamed hir heart to see him. Whereof Alexander beeinge
tolde, graunted hir hys safe conduct. By meanes whereof, after she had
chosen out some of hir principall women, leauinge the rest in a certayne
place in very good order, she went towardes Alexander, of whom she was
curteously entertayned, and then with very good countenaunce, shee
offered vnto him the effect of al her ability. Who prayed hir to tell
him, if he were able to do her pleasure, and promised that hir request
should be accomplished. She aunswered that hir comminge was not to
demaund either landes or dominions, (whereof she had sufficient) but
rather to knowe and be acquainted with sutch a famous Prince as hee was,
of whom she had heard maruellous and straunge report. But the chiefest
cause of hir comminge was, to pray him of carnal copulation, that she
might be conceiued with childe, and haue an heire begotten of so
excellent a Prince, telling him that she was come of noble kinde, and of
high parentage, and that he ought not to disdaine hir vse. Promisinge
hym that if it pleased the Gods, that she should haue a daughter, she
would nourishe it her selfe, and make it her vniuersall Heire, and if it
were a Sonne, she would send it vnto him. Alexander asked her if shee
woulde go with hym to the warres, which if she would, he promised hir
his company. But she excusinge hir selfe, aunswered that she could not
goe with hym without great shame, besides the hazardinge the losse of
her kingdome. Wherefore she prayed him agayne to satisfie hir request.
Finally she kept company with Alexander by

the space of <span class = "smallroman">XIII</span> dayes in publike and

home to hir prouince. But as it is the property of tyme to consume all
thinges: euen so the kingdome and power of the Amazones grew to vtter
decay, no one sutch nation at this day to be found. For what monstruous
Sexe was this that durst not onely by many armies encountre with
puissant nations, but also by single Combate, to fight with that
terrible personage Hercules, whose vnspeakable and incredible labours
and victories, are by antiquity reported to be sutch, as none but he,
durst euer aduenture the like. What nation euer comparable to the
Greekes, or the Athenian Citty? and yet these mankinde women for reuenge
shronke not to peerce their Prouince. What like besieged towne as that
of Troy was? and yet Penthesilea one of their Queenes with hir mayny,
indeuoured to rayse the Greekes, that so many yeares had lien before the
same. What Queene (nay what Stalant) durst sue for company of meanest
man? any yet one of these presumed to begge the matche of the mightiest
Monarch that euer ruled the world. The maners and qualities of which
nation, bycause they were Women of no common spirite and boldnesse, bee
thought good in the front of this second Volume to be described: bycause
of dyuers Womens liues plentifull variety is offered in the sequele. And

<p><span class = "firstword">Great</span> Monarches and Princes be the
Gods, and only Rulers vpon Earth, and as they be placed by God’s only
prouydence and disposition, to conquere and rule the same, euen so in
victorious battayles and honorable Exploytes, they ought to rule and
order their conquestes like Gods: that is to saye, to vse moderate
behauiour to their Captiues and slaues, specially to the weaker sort and
feminine kynde, whom like Tyrauntes and barbarous, they ought not to
corrupt and abuse, but like Christians and vertuous victors, to cherish
and preserue their honour. For what can bee safe to a woman (sayde
Lucrece, when she was rauished by the Romayn Tarquine) her chastity
beinge defiled? Or what can be safe to a man, that geueth himselfe to
incontinency? For when he hath despoyled the virgin, robbed the wyfe, or
abused the Wydow of their honor and good name, they protrude themselues
into many Myseries, they bee impudent, Vnshamefaste, Aduenturous, and
Carelesse howe many myschiefes they doe. And when a Prince or Gouerner
doth geue himself to licentious life, what mischieues, what rapes, what
murders doth hee commit? No frende, no Foe, no subiect, no enemy doth he
spare or defende. Contrarywise, the mercifull and continent captayne, by
subduinge hys affections recouereth immortall fame, which this History
of kinge Alexander full well declareth. And because before we spake of
that great conqueror in the Nouell of the Amazones, and of the repayre
of Queene Thalestris for vse of his body, at what tyme (as&nbsp;Curtius
sayth) he fell from vertue to vice: we purpose in thys, to declare the
great contynencie and mercy that hee vsed to Sisigambis, the wife of the
Persian prince Darius, and briefly to touch the time of his abused life,
which in this maner doth begin. Alexander the great hauing vanquished
Darius and his infinite army, and retiringe wyth hys hoast from the
pursute and slaughter of the Persians, entred into
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page167" id = "page167">167</a></span>
their campe to recreate himselfe. And beinge with his familiers in the
mids of his banket, they sodaynly heard a pitifull cry, with straung
howlinge and cryinge out, which did very mutch aston them. The Wyfe and
Mother of Darius, with the other noble women newly taken Prisoners, were
the occasion of that present noyse, by lamentinge of Darius, whom they
beleeued to be slayne, and which opinion they conceyued through one of
the Eunuches, which standinge before Their tent doore, saw a Souldier
beare a peece of Darius Diademe. For which cause Alexander, pityinge
their misery, sent a noble man called Leonatus to signifie vnto them
that they were deceyued, for that Darius was liuing. Repayring towards
the Tent where the women were with certayne armed men, he sent word
before, that he was comminge to them with message from the kinge. But
when sutche as stoode at the tent doore saw armed men, they thought they
had bene sent to murder the Ladies: for which cause they ran in to them,
cryinge that their last houre was come, for the souldiers were at hande
to kille them. When Leonatus was entred the Pauilion, the Mother and
wife of Darius fell downe at hys feete, intreatinge him that before they
were slayne, he would suffer them to bury Darius, accordinge to the
order and maner of his Countrey, after the performance of which
obsequies, they were content (they sayd) willingly to suffer death.
Leonatus assured them, that both Darius was aliue, and that there was no
harme ment towardes them, but should remayne in the same state they were
in before. When Sisigambis heard those wordes, she suffered her selfe to
bee lifted vp from the grounde, and to receyue some comforte. The next
day, Alexander with great diligence buried the bodies of sutch of his
owne men as coulde be founde, and willed the same to be done to the
noble men of the Persians geuinge licence to Darius mother to Bury so
many as she liste, after the custome of her Countrey. She performed the
same to a few that were next of her kin, accordinge to the hability of
their presente fortune, for if shee should haue vsed the Persians Pompe
therein, the Macedonians might haue enuied it, whych beinge victors,
vsed no great curiosity in the matter. When the due was performed to the
dead, Alexander signified to the women prisoners, that hee himselfe
would come to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page168" id = "page168">168</a></span>
visite them, and causinge sutch as came with him to tary without, he
onely with Ephestion entred in amongs them. The same Ephestion of all
men was best beloued of Alexander, brought vp in his company from his
youth, and most priuy with him in all thinges. There was none that had
sutch liberty to speke his mynde playnly to the kinge as hee had, whych
hee vsed after sutch sorte, that he seemed to doe it by no authority,
but by sufferaunce. And as he was of like yeres vnto him, so in shape
and personage he did somwhat excell him. Wherefore the Women thinkinge
Ephestion to be the kinge, did fall down and worship him (as&nbsp;their
Countrey maner was to do to kinges) till sutch time as one of the
Eunuches that was taken prisoner, shewed which of them was Alexander.
Then Sisigambis fell down at his feete, requiringe pardon of her
Ignorance, forsomutch as she did neuer see him before. The kinge tooke
her vp by the hande, and sayd: “Mother you be not deceiued: for this is
Alexander also.” Then he behaued himselfe after sutch a maner, that hee
exceeded in continency and compassion, all the kinges that had bin
before his time. He entertayned the two Queenes with those virgins that
were of excellent beauty, so reuerently, as if they had bin his sisters.
He not onely absteyned from al violation of Darius wyfe, which in beauty
excelled all the women of hir time, but also tooke great care and
diligence, that none other should procure her any dishonour. And to all
the women he commaunded their ornaments, and apparell to be restored: so
that they wanted nothinge of the magnificence of their former estate,
sauinge only the assured trust that creatures want in misery: which
thinges considered by Sisigambis, she said vnto the kinge: “Sir, your
goodnes towards vs, doth deserue that we should make the same prayer for
you, that whilome we did for Darius: and we perceive you worthy to passe
so great a king as he was, in felicity and good fortune, that abound so
in iustice and clemency. It pleaseth you to terme me by the name Mother
and Queene: but I confesse my selfe to bee your handmayde. For both I
conceiue the greatnesse of my state past, and feele that I can bear this
present seruitude. It lieth only in your hands how we shal be delt
withall, and whether you will make vs notable to the worlde through your
clemency or cruelty.” The king comforted them al
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page169" id = "page169">169</a></span>
that he might, and willinge them to be of good cheere tooke Darius sonne
in his armes. Thereat the childe was nothing afraid, hauing neuer seene
him before, but toke and imbraced him about the necke. He was so moued
with the constancy of the childe, as he beheld Ephestion, and sayde,
“Oh, I&nbsp;would that Darius had had some part of this childe’s
gentlenesse.” Which mercy, continency, humility and constancy of minde
in Alexander, if hee had still kept to his latter daies, might haue bin
accoumpted mutch more fortunate than he was, when hauinge subdued all
Asia from Hellespont to the ocean Sea, he did counterfayte the Triumphes
of Bacchus. Or if amonges the residue of his conquests, hee would haue
trauayled to ouercome his pride and wrath, beinge vices inuincible. Or
in his dronkennes abstayned from the slaughter of his Nobility, and not
to haue put to death those excellent men of warre without iudgement,
which helped him to conquer so many Nations: but at this time the
greatnes of his fortune had not yet altered his nature, although
afterwards he could not beare his victories with that Vertue, wherewith
he wan them: for when he gaue himself to feasting and banquettinge, he
vsed the company of Harlots: amonges whom there was one Thais, who vpon
a day in hir dronkennesse, affirmed to Alexander, that he should
wonderfully win the fauour of the Greeks, if hee commaunded the Palace
of Persepolis to be set on fire. The destruction whereof (she sayd) they
greatly desired, for so mutch as the same was the chiefe seat of the
kings of Persia, which in times past had destroyed so many great
Citties. When the dronken harlot had giuen her sentence, there were
other present, who being likewise dronken, confirmed hir wordes.
Alexander then that had in him more inclination of heat than of
pacience, sayd: “Why do we not then recouer the fauour of the Greekes by
settinge this Citty on fier?” They were all chafed with drinkinge, and
rose immediately vpon those words to burne that city in their
dronkennesse, which the men of warre had spared in their fury. The kinge
himselfe first, and after his guestes, his seruauntes and his
Concubines, set fier in the Pallace, which beinge builded for the most
part of Ceder trees, became sodenly in a flame. When the army that was
encamped neere vnto the City, sawe the fire, which they thought had ben
kindled by
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page170" id = "page170">170</a></span>
some casualty, they came runninge to quenche the same againe. But when
they sawe the kynge there presente increasynge the fyre, they poured
downe the water whych they broughte, and helped lykewyse the matter
forwardes. Thus the Pallace that was the heade of the whole Orient, from
whence so many nations before had fetched their lawes to liue vnder, the
Seat of so many kynges, the onely Terror sometime of Greece, the same
that had bin the sender forth of 9000 Ships, and of the armes that
ouerflowed all Europa, that made Brydges ouer the Sea, and vndermined
mountaynes where the Sea hath now his course, was consumed and had his
ende, and neuer rose againe in all the age that did ensue: for the
kynges of Macedon vsed other Citties which be now in the Persians
handes. The destruction of this citty was sutch, that the foundation
thereof at thys day could not be found, but that riuer of Araxes doth
shew where it stoode, which was distant from Persepolis <span class =
"smallroman">XX.</span> furlonges, as the Inhabitants rather doe beleue
than know. The Macedonians were ashamed that so noble a Citty was
destroyed by their kinge in his dronkennes: yet at length it was turned
into an earnest matter, and were content to thincke it expedient that
the Citty should haue ben destroyed after that maner. But it is
certayne, that when Alexander had taken his rest, and was become better
aduised, hee repented him of his doinge: and after he had kept company
with Thalestris aforesayde, which was Queene of the Amazones, hee
tourned his continency and moderation (beinge the most excellent vertues
appearinge in any kind of estate) into pride and voluptuousnes, not
esteeminge his countrey customes, nor the holsome temperance that was in
the vsages, and discipline of kynges of Macedon. For he iudged their
ciuill vsage and maner, to be ouer base for his greatnesse, but did
counterfaite the height and pompe of the kings of Persia, representinge
the greatnesse of the Gods. Hee was content to suffre men there to fall
downe flat vppon the grounde and worship him, and accustomed the victors
of so many nacions, by litle and litle to seruile offices, couetinge to
make them like vnto his Captiues. He ware vpon his head a Diademe of
Purple interpaled with white, like as Darius was accustomed: and
fashioned his aparell after the maner of the Persians, without
scrupulosity of any euil token that is signified,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page171" id = "page171">171</a></span>
for the victorer to change his habite into the fashion of him whom he
had vanquished: and although he vaunted, that he ware the spoyles of his
enemies, yet with those spoiles he put vpon him their euil maners, and
the insolency of the mynde followed the pride of the apparell. Besides
he sealed sutch Letters as he sent into Europa, with his accustomed
seale, but all the Letters he sent abroade into Asia, were sealed with
Darius Ringe. So it appeared that one minde could not beare the
greatnesse that appertayned to two. He apparelled also his frends, his
Captayns, and his horsemen in Persian apparell, whereat though they
grudged in their mindes, yet they durst not refuse it, for feare of his
displeasure. His courte was replenished with Concubins, for he still
mainteined three hundred, and threescore that belonged to Darius, and
amonge them were flocks of Eunuches accustomed to performe the vse of
women. The olde Souldiours of Philip naturally abhorringe sutch thinges,
manyfestly withstoode to be infected with sutch voluptuousnes, and
strange customes: <ins class = "notation" title =
"printed ‘where-/vpon’ at line break">wherevpon</ins>
there rose a general talke and opinion
throughout the campe, that they had lost more by the victory, than they
won by the wars. For when they sawe themselues ouercome in sutch
excesse, and forayne customes so to preuayle, they iudged it a simple
guerdon of their longe beeinge abroade, to returne home in prisoners
maner. They began to be ashamed of their kinge, that was more like to
sutch as were subdued, than to them that were victorious: and that of a
kinge of Macedon, was become a Prince of Persia, and one of Darius
Courtiers. Thus this noble Prince from continency and mercy fell into
all kynde of disorder, the originall whereof, hee tooke by delite in
Women, which beinge vsed in sort lawfull, be great comfortes and
delightes, otherwise, the very springe of all cruelty and mischife.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">Qvintus Curtius</span>, that notable

of the Thracian kinde, who for lucre rather than loue, for gayne than
gratitude, promysed golden Hylles to thys dystressed poore Gentlewoman.
But shee in the ende payinge hym hys well deserued hyre, was liked and
praysed of Alexander for hir aduenturous facte, beinge not one of the
least vertues that shined in him, before hee grewe to excessyue abuse:
but bycause Plutarch in hys Treatyse <i>De claris mulieribus</i>, more
at large recounteth this Hystory, I&nbsp;haue thought good almost
(<i>verbatim</i>) to follow him. Theagenes a Gentleman of Thebes,
ioyninge himselfe wyth Epaminondas, and Pelopidas, and with other noble
men, for preseruation of their countrey of Greece, was slayne in the
chace of his enemyes, as he pursued one of the chyefe of hys
aduersaries, the same cryinge oute vnto him: “Whether doest thou pursue
vs, Theagenes?” “Euen to Macedonia:” aunswered hee. Thys Gentleman thus
slayne had a sister, whose vertue and neerenesse of kin by noble deedes,
she well witnessed, although she was not well able to manifest her
vertue, for the aduersity of the tyme, but by pacient sufferance of the
common calamityes. For after Alexander had won the Citty of Thebes, the
Souldiours greedy of Spoyle runninge vp and downe the Citty, euery of
them chauncinge vppon sutch Booty as Fortune offred them, it hapned that
a Captayne of the Thracian horsmen, a&nbsp;barbarous, and wycked wretch,
came to the house of Timoclia, who somewhat neere the kynge both in
name, and Kyn, in manners, and conditions, was greatly different from
him: hee
<span class = "pagenum">

neyther regardynge the noble house, ne yet the chastity of hir
forepassed life, vpon a tyme after supper, glutted and swilled wyth
abundance of wine, caused Timoclia forcibly to be haled to his dronken
Couch: and not contented with the forced wronge, as they were in talke
together, diligently demaunded of her, if she had in no place hidden any
Golde or Siluer, and partly by threates, and partely by promise to keepe
her as his wyfe, endeuoured to get that he desired: but shee being of
ready wit, takinge that offered occasion of her aduersary: “I&nbsp;would
to God,” (sayd shee) “that it had beene my lucke to haue died before
thys night, rather then to liue: for hitherto haue I kept my body pure
and vntouched from all despite, and villany, vntill vnlucky fate forced
mee to yelde to thy disordinate lust: but sith my hap is sutch, why
should I conceale those thyngs that bee thine owne, thou beinge mine

I&nbsp;buried in the bowels of the same. Then marke my words, beare them
well in mynde, sith lot had wrought me this mishap. I&nbsp;hauinge
plenty of coyned siluer, and of fyned gold no little store besydes sutch
Iewels as belonge to the settinge forth of the grace of woman’s beauty,
of valure and price inestimable: when I saw this Citty brought to sutch
distresse as vnpossible to be saued from takinge, all the same I threw
away, or more truely to say, I&nbsp;whelmed altogether in a drye Ditche
voyde of water, which my fact fewe or none did knowe. The Pit is couered
with a little couer aboue, and thickly round about beset with bushes and
thornes. Those goods will make thee a welthy personage, none in all the

bequeathe to thee, as on whom I thinke them well bestowed.” This greedy
Lecher, laughinge to him selfe for this sodaine pray, and thinking that
his lady fast holden within his barbarous armes had tolde him truth,
routed in his filthy Couch till the day had discouered the morning
light, then gapinge for his hoped gaine, he rose and prayed her to tell
the place, that he might recouer the same. She then brought him into her
Garden, the doore whereof she commaunded to be shut, that none might
enter. He in his Hose and Doublet, went downe to the bottome of the Pit:
when Timoclia perceiued him down, she beckned for certaine of her maids,
and rolled downe diuers great stones with her own hands, which of
purpose she had caused to be placed there, and commaunded hir maides to
tumble downe the like. By which meanes she killed that lecherous and
couetous vilayne, that rather carked to satisfie his desire, than
coueted to obserue hys promisd faith. Which afterwardes beinge knowen to
the Macedonians, they haled his body out of the Pit: for Alexander had
made proclamation, that none should dare to kill any Thebane, and
therefore apprehendinge Timoclia, they brought her to the kinge,
accusinge her for doinge that murder: who by her countenaunce, and
stature of body, and by her behauiour and grauity of maners, beheld in
her the very image of gentle kinde. And first of al, he asked her what
she was: to whom boldly with constant cheere, she stoutely answered:
“Theagenes was my brother (said she) who beinge a valiaunt Captaine, and
fightinge against you for the common safegard of the Greeks, was slaine
at Chæronea, that we together might not sustaine, and proue the
miseries, wherewith we be now oppressed: but I rather than to suffer
violence vnworthy of our race and stocke, am in your maiestie’s presence
brought ready to refuse no death: for better it were for mee to dye,
than feele sutch another night, except thou commaunde the contrary.”
These wordes were vttered in sutch rufull plight, as the standers by
could not forbeare to weepe. But Alexander sayinge, that hee not onely
pitied the woman endewed with so noble wit, but mutch more wondred at
her vertue and wisedome, commaunded the Princes of his army, to foresee
no wronge or violence to be done to the Gentlewoman. He gaue order also,
that Timoclia and al
<span class = "pagenum">

her kin, should be garded and defended from slaughter or other wronges.
What say yee (good Ladies) to the heart of this gentlewoman that durst
be so bolde to stone this Caytife wretch to death, and for wronge done
to her bodie til that tyme vntouched, to wronge the corps of him that
sauoured of no gentle kinde: who rather for earthly mucke, than for loue
of suche a pleasaunt prisoner, exchaunged Loue for Gold? but note hereby
what force the puritie of mynde vnwilling of beastlye lust doth carye in
it selfe: a&nbsp;simple woman voyde of helpe, not backed with defence of
husbande’s ayde, doth bring a mighty Captayne, a&nbsp;strong and lofty
lubber to enter into a Caue, and when shee saw her best aduauntage,
thacked him with stones, vntil he groaned foorth his grieslye ghost.
Such is the might and prowesse of chastitie: no charge to burdennous or

Gentleman or Courtier towardes his soueraine Lord, ought to be called
Liberalitie and Curtesie, or rather Band and Dutie. Which question is
not proponed with out greate reason. For so muche as ech man doth know,
that a seruaunt do what he can for his Mayster, or lette him imploy the
vttermost of his endeuour, al the labor and trauayle he bestoweth, all
trouble and daunger which he sustayneth, is to little, yea and the same
his very bounden duty. Haue wee not red of many, and knowne the lyke
that to gratifye their prince and mayster, haue into a thousande
daungers and like number of deaths, aduentured their own propre liues?
Marcus Antonius that notable oratour beying accused of incest, and
broughte to the iudgement seate, his accusers required that his seruante
should be called, for because he bare the candel before his maister,
when hee went to do the deede, who seyng his mayster’s life and death to
depend vpon his euidence, vtterly denied the facte: and notwithstanding
that he was whipped, racked, and suffered other cruel tormentes, would
rather haue loste his lyfe than accuse and betray his mayster.
I&nbsp;could alleage and bring forth in place, the example of Mycithus,
the seruaunt of one Anaxilaus Messenius, the fidelitye of the seruauntes
of Plotinus Plancus, the faythful mayden called Pythias, that waited
vpon Octauia, the chast Empresse and wife of that monster Nero, with
diuers other: but that I thinke they be to the learned wel knowen, and
of the vnlearned the vertue of seruauntes fidelitye is greatly liked and
commended: but if the faythful seruaunt know that his desertes do gayne
the grace and fauoure of
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page177" id = "page177">177</a></span>
his mayster, what trauayles, what payns ought he to suffer to mayntayne
his reputation and to encrease the fauour obtayned? for as the common
prouerbe and wise sayinge reporteth, that the vertve is no lesse to
conserue Frendship gotten, than the wisedome was great to get and win
the same. Other there be which do contrarily contend, and with very
stronge argumentes do force to proue that al which the seruant doth
besydes his duetye and beyond the obligation, wherein he is bound to his
mayster, is and ought to be termed, Liberality, which is a matter to
prouoke his patrone and mayster to deuyse new benefytes for his
seruaunte: and that at al tymes when a man doth his duty and seruice
appoynted by his mayster, executing the same with all diligence and
industry requisite therunto, that then he deserueth to be rewarded.
Which is not to be discommended. For no true and honest seruant will
refuse any trauayle for commodity of his mayster, ne yet discrete and
wyse mayster will leaue the same vnrewarded according to that portion of
ability wherewith he is possessed: but leauinge questions and
disputacion aside procede we to that which this Nouel purposeth.
I&nbsp;say then that there was in the kyngdome of Persia, a&nbsp;kyng
called Artaxerxes, a&nbsp;man of most noble mynde, and of great prowesse
in armes. This was he that firste beynge a priuate man of armes, not
hauing as yet obtayned any degree in the fielde, kylled Artabanus the
last kinge of the Arsacides, whose souldiour he was, and recouered the
Persian kingdome, which was then in the Macedonians subiection
(by&nbsp;the death of Darius, which was vanquished by Alexander the
great) the space of 538 yeares. This noble gentleman hauing deliuered
all Persia, and created king, kept a princely court, wherin were many
magnificent factes and vertuous deedes exercised and done, and hee
himselfe moste noble in all affayres, besydes the tytles which hee
worthelye wanne in many bloudy battels, was estemed throughout the east
part of the worlde, to be the most liberal and magnanimous prince that
in any age euer raigned: in feastes and bankets he was an other
Lucullus, royally entertaining strangers that repayred to his court.
This king had a Senescall or steward, named Ariobarzanes, whose office
was, that when the king made any pompous or publike feast, to mount vpon
a whyte Courser with a Mace of gold in
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page178" id = "page178">178</a></span>
his hand, and to ride before the esquiers and Sewers for the king’s own
mouth, and those also that bare the king’s meat in vessel of gold
couered with fine napery, wrought and purled with most beautiful
workemanship of silke and gold. This office of Senescall was highly
estemed and commonly wont to be geuen to one of the chiefest Barons of
the Realm. Wherfore this Ariobarzanes besydes noble Linage and
incomparable ritches was the most curtious and liberal knight that
frequented the court whose immoderate expence was such, as leuing the
mean, wherin al vertu consisteth, by reason of outrage which many times
he vsed he fel into the vice of prodigality, wherby he semed not only in
curtious dedes to compare with the king, but also contended to excel
him. One day the king for his recreation called for the chessebord,
requiring Ariobarzanes to kepe him company, which game in those dais
among the Persians was in greate vse, in such wise as a player at the
Chestes was no les commended then amonge vs in these dais an excelent
Oratour or famous learned man: yea and the verye same game in common vse
in the Court, and noble mens houses of oure time, no doubt very
commendable and meete to be practised by all states and degrees. The
king and Ariobarzanes being sette downe at a table in the greate Hall of
the Pallace, one right against another, accompanied with a great number
of noble personages and Gentlemen lookinge vpon them, and marking their
playe with greate silence, they began to counter one another with the
Chesse-men. Ariobarzanes, whether it was that he played better than the
kinge, or whether the kinge took no heede to his game, or what so euer
the occasion was, hee coursed the king to such a narow straight, as he
could not auoid, but within two or three draughtes, he must be forced to
receiue the Checkemate: which the king perceiuing, and considering the
daunger of the Mate, by and by there grew a greater colour in his face
than was wont to bee, and imagininge how hee mighte auoyde the mate,
besides his blushing he shaked his head, and fetched out diuers sighes,
whereby the standers by that marked the game, perceiued that hee was
dryuen to his shiftes. The Senescall espyinge the kinge’s demeanour, and
seeing the honest shamefastenesse of the king, would not suffer him to
receiue such a foyle, but made a draught by remouing his
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page179" id = "page179">179</a></span>
knighte backe, to open a way for the King to passe, as not onely hee
deliuered him from the daunger of the Mate, but also lost one of his
Rockes for lacke of taking hede: whereupon the game rested equall. The
King (who knew the good nature and noble mynde of his seruaunt, by
experience of the same in other causes) fayning that hee had ouerseene
the takinge of hys rocke, gaue ouer the game, and rysing vp, sayd: “No
more Ariobarzanes, the game is yours, and I confesse my selfe ouercome.”
The king thought that Ariobarzanes did not the same so much for
curtesie, as to bynde his soueraigne lorde and king by benefit to
recompence his subiecte’s like behauiour, which he did not very well
like, and therfore would play no more. Notwithstanding the king neither
by signe or deede, ne yet in talke, shewed any token of displesure for
that curtesie done. How be it, he would that Ariobarzanes in semblable
act, shoulde abstayne to shewe himselfe curteous or liberal, except it
were to his inferiours and equalles, because it is not conuenient for a
seruant to contend with his maister in those qualityes. Not long after
the kinge beyng at Persepolis (the principal citye of Persia,) ordayned
a notable day of hunting of diuers beastes of that countrey breede: and
when all thinges were in a readinesse he with the most part of his Court
repayred to the pastyme. When they were come into the place, the king
commaunded a woodde to be set about with nettes and toiles, and
appointed eche man where he should stand in most conuenient place, and
he himselfe attended with the dogs and hornes to cause the beastes to
issue forth oute of their Caues. And beholde, they raysed a wyld beast,
which with greate swyftnesse leapte ouer the nettes and ranne awaye with
greate spede. The King seyng that strange beast, purposed to pursue him
to death: and makinge a signe to certayne of his noble men which hee
desired to keepe him companye hee gaue the rayne and spurre to his
horse, and followinge the chace Ariobarzanes was one of those noble men
which pursued the game. It chaunced that day the kinge rode vpon a
horse, that was the swiftest runner in his stable, which hee esteemed
better then a thousande other, as wel for his velocity, as for his
readinesse in factes of armes. Thus following with bridle at will, the
flying rather then running beast, they wer deuided far from their
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page180" id = "page180">180</a></span>
company, and by reason of the kinge’s spedines, none was able to followe
him but Ariobarzanes, and behind him one of his seruants vpon a good
horse which alwaies he vsed in hunting matters, which horse was counted
the beste in all the court. And thus following the chace with galloping
spede Ariobarzanes at length espyed the horse of his soueraigne lord had
lost his shooes before, and that the stones had surbated his hoofes,
wherupon the kyng was driven either to geue ouer the chace or else to
marre his horse: and neyther of these two necessities but would haue
greatly displeased the kinge, that perceiued not his horse to be vnshod.
The Senescall did no sooner espye the same but sodainly dismounted from
his owne, caused his man to deliuer vnto him a hammer and nailes (which
for such like chaunces he always caried aboute him) and toke of two
shoes from the horse feete of his good horse, to set vpon the kynge’s
not caring for his own rather then the king should forgoe his pleasure:
wherfore hallowing the kinge which was earnestly bent vppon the chace,
tolde him of the daunger wherein his horse was for lacke of shoes. The
kinge hearinge that lighted from his horse, and seyng two shooes in
Ariobarzanes manne’s hand, thinking that Ariobarzanes had brought them
with him, or that they were the shoes which fell from his owne, taried
stil vntil his horse was shod. But when he saw the notable horse of his
senescall vnshod before, then he thought that to be the curtesie of
Ariobarzanes, and so did let the matter passe, studying by lyke meanes
to requite him with Curtesie, which forced himselfe to surmount in the
same: and when his horse was shod, he gaue the same to Ariobarzanes in
rewarde. And so the king chose rather to lose his pleasure of hunting,
then to suffer himselfe by his man to be excelled in curtesie, wel
noting the stoutnesse of Ariobarzanes mynde which semed to haue a will
to contend with his prince in factes renoumed and liberal. The senescall
thought it not conuenient to refuse the gyft of his liege lord, but
accepted the same with like good will as before he shod his horse, still
expectinge occasion how he might surpas his master in curtesie and so to
bind him to requite the same againe. They had not taried there long, but
many of those that followed did ouertake them. And then the king got vp
vpon a spare horse and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page181" id = "page181">181</a></span>
returned to the city with all his company. Within few daies after the
king by proclamation sommoned a solemne and pompous iust and tryumph at
the tilt, to be done vpon the kalends of May next ensuing. The reward
appointed the victor and best Doer in the same was a couragious and
goodly curser with a brydle and byt of fine gold rychly wrought,
a&nbsp;saddle correspondent of passing great pryce, the furniture and
trappers for the brydle and saddle of like cost and workmanship, the
rayns wer twoo chaynes of golde very artificially made, the barbe and
couerture of the horse of cloth of golde fringed round about with like
gold, ouer which horse was placed a fine sword the hiltes an chape
wherof together with the scabard wer curiously beset with Pearles and
Precious stones of Inestimable value. On the other syde was placed a
very beautiful and stronge Mace, verye cunninglye wrought with damaskin.
The Horse was placed in forme of triumph, and besydes the same all the
Armours and weapons meete for a Combatante Knyghte, riche and fayre
without comparison. The Placart was marueylous and stronge, the Launce
was guilte and bygge, as none greatter in all the troupe of the
chalengers and defendauntes. And all those furnitures were appoynted to
be geuen to him that should do best that day. A&nbsp;greate assemblye of
straungers repayred to that solemne feast, as wel to doe deedes of
Armes, as to looke vpon that pompous tryumph. Of the kynge’s Subiectes
there was neither knyghte nor baron, but in ryche and sumptuous apparell
appeared that day, amonges whom, of chiefest fame the kynge’s eldest
sonne was the fyrst that gaue his name, a&nbsp;Gentlemanne very
valorous, and in deedes of armes of passing valour brought vp from his
very youth, and trayned in the fielde and other warlyke exercises. The
Senescall also caused his name to be inrolled: the like didde other
knyghtes as wel Persians as other straungers: for that the proclamation
was general, with safeconducte for all forrayners, noble men or other
that should make their repayre. The king had elected three auncient
Barons to be Judges and Arbitratours of their deedes, sutch as in their
tyme for their owne personages had bene very valiant, and in many
enterprises well exercised, men of great discretion and iudgement. Their
stage was placed in the middes of the Listes, to viewe and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page182" id = "page182">182</a></span>
marke the Counterbuffes and blowes of the Combatants. We nede not to
remember, ne ought to forget the number of ladies and gentlewomen
assembled out of al partes to behold and view this triumphe, and
peraduenture eche knight that ran that day was not without his amorous
lady to note and behold his actiuity and prowesse, euery of them wearing
his ladie’s sleeue, gloue, or other token, according to the common
custome in such lyke cases. At the day and houre appoynted appeared all
the Combatantes in greate Tryumphe and Pompe, with rych furnitures as
wel vpon them selues as vpon their horse. The triumphe begon and many
Launces broken in good order, on either sides Iudgement was geuen
generally that the Senescall Ariobarzanes had wonne the prise, and next
vnto him the kinge’s sonne did passe them all, for that none of al the
combatantes hadde broken past <span class = "smallroman">V.</span>
staues, and the sayd yong Gentleman had in the face of his aduersary
broken in pieces <span class = "smallroman">IX.</span> at the least. The
Senescall brought for the eleuen launces, which were couragiously and
<ins class = "correction" title = "error for ‘honourably’">houourably</ins>
broken, by breaking of the last staffe
which was the twelfth he was iudged most worthy. The condition wherof
was, that euery combatant should runne twelue courses with twelue
launces, and he whiche should first breake the same should without doubt
or further controuersie obtayne the reward. What pleasure and delight
the king did conceiue to see his sonne behaue him selfe so valiantly
that day, I&nbsp;referre to the iudgement of fathers, that haue children
endued with like actiuity. But yet it greued him that the Senescall had
the greater aduantage, and yet being a matter so wel knowen and
discerned by the Iudges, like a wyse man he discembled his countenaunce.
On the other syde, the yong Gentleman which did combate before his
amorous ladye was very sorrowful for that he was voyde of hope of the
chiefest honour. So that betwene the father and the sonne, was one very
thought and desire: but the vertue and valor of the Senescall did cut of
eythers greefe. Now the tyme was come that the Senescall should runne
with his last staffe mounted vppon the horse which the king gaue him
when he was an huntyng, who knowing wel that the king was very desirous
that his son should excell all men, perceyued likewyse the inflamed mynd
of the yonge gentleman for the presence of his lady to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page183" id = "page183">183</a></span>
aspyre the honour, purposed to geue ouer the honour atchieued by
himselfe, to leaue it to the sonne and heir of his lorde and mayster:
and yet hee knewe ful wel that those his curtesies pleased not the king,
neuerthelesse he was determined to perseuer in his opinion, not to
bereue the king of his glory, but onely to acquire fame and honour for
him selfe. But fully mynded that the honour of the tryumphe should be
geuen to the kynge’s sonne, he welded the staffe within his reste, and
when he was ready to encounter (because it was he that shold come
agaynst him,) he let fal his launce out of his handes, and said:
“Farewel this curtesie of myne, sith it is no better taken.” The kinge’s
sonne gaue a gentle counterbuffe vpon the Placarde of the Senescall, and
brake his staffe in many pieces, which was the <span class =
"smallroman">X.</span> course. Many heard the wordes that the senescall
spake when his staffe fell out of his handes, and the standers by well
perceiued that he was not minded to geue the laste blowe, bicause the
king’s sonne might haue the honor of the triumph, which he desyred so
much. Then Ariobarzanes departed the listes: and the Prince withoute any
great resistance wan the prise and victory. And so with sounde of
diuerse instruments the prise borne before him, he was throughout the
citie honorably conueyed, and among other, the senescall still waited
vpon him with mery countenance, greatly praising and exalting the
valiance of the yong Prince. The king which was a very wise man, and
many times hauing experience of the chiualry of his Senescall at other
Tourneis, Iustes, Barriers, and Battels, and always finding him to be
prudent, politike, and for his person very valiant, knewe to well that
the fall of his launce was not by chaunce but of purpose, continued his
opinion of his Senescall’s liberalitye and courage. And to say the
trouth, such was his exceding curtesie, as fewe may be found to imitate
the same. We daily se that many be liberall of Fortune’s goods
inuestinge some with promotion, some with apparel, Gold and Siluer,
Iewels and other things of great value. We see also noble men,
bountifull to theyr seruaunts, not onely of mouable <ins class =
"correction" title = "error for ‘things’">thiugs</ins>, but also of
Castels, Lands, and Cities: what shal we speake of them, which will not
sticke to sheade their owne bloud, and many tymes to spende theire lyfe
to do their frendes good? Of those and such like examples, all
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page184" id = "page184">184</a></span>
recordes be full: but a man that contemneth fame and glorye or is of his
owne honour liberal, is neuer founde. The victorious Captayne after the
bloudy battayle, giueth the spoyle of his ennemies to his souldiours,
rewardeth them with prisoners, departeth vnto them the whole praye, but
the glory and honor of the battel he reserueth vnto himselfe. And as
diuinely the father of Romaine eloquence doth say, how that philosophers
by recording the glorious gestes and dedes of others, do seke after
glory themselues. The king was displeased with these noble dedes and
curtesie of his Senescall, because he thought it not mete or decente
that a Subiecte and seruant should compare with his lord and mayster:
and therfore did not bare him that louing and chereful countenance which
hee was wont to doe. And in the ende, purposed to let him know, that he
spent his brayns in very great errour, if he thought to force his
mayster to be bound or beneficial vnto him, as herafter you shal
perceiue. There was an auncient and approued custome in Persia, that the
kinges yerely did solemnise an Anniuersarye of theyr Coronation with
great feast and tryumph, vpon which day all the Barons of the kyngdome
were bounde to repayre to the courte where the king by the space of
<span class = "smallroman">VIII.</span> dayes with sumptuous bankets and
other feastes kept open house. Vpon the Anniuersary day of Artaxerxes’
coronation, when al thinges were disposed in order, the king desirous to
accomplish a certayne conceiued determination commaunded one of his
faythful chamberlaynes spedely to seeke out Ariobarzanes, which he did,
and telling him the kinge’s message, sayde: “My lorde Ariobarzanes, the
king hath willed me to say vnto you, that his pleasure is, that you in
your own person euen forthwith shal cary your white steede and Courser,
the mace of gold, and other ensignes due to the office of Senescal vnto
Darius, your mortal enemy, and in his maiestye’s behalfe to say vnto
him, that the kynge hath geuen him that office, and hath clerely
dispossessed you thereof.” Ariobarzanes hearing those heauy newes, was
like to dye for sorrowe, and the greatter was his grief, because it was
geuen to his greatest enemy. Notwithstanding lyke a gentleman of noble
stomacke, would not in open appearaunce signifie the displeasure which
hee conceiued within, but with mery cheare and louing countenaunce
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page185" id = "page185">185</a></span>
answered the chamberlayne: “Do my right humble commendations vnto the
king’s maiesty, and say vnto him, that like as he is soueraine lord of
all this land, and I his faythful subiecte, euen so mine office, my
lyfe, landes and goods, be at his disposition, and that willinglye I wil
performe his hest.” When he had spoken those woordes hee rendred vp his
office to Darius, who at diner serued in the same. And when the king was
set, Ariobarzanes with comly countenance sate downe among the rest of
the lords, which sodenlye deposition and depriuation, did maruelously
amaze the whole assembly, euery man secretly speking their mind either
in praise or dispraise of the fact. The king all the dinner time, did
marke and note the countenance of Ariobarzanes, which was pleasaunt and
merie as it was wont to be, whereat the kinge did greately maruell: and
to attaine the ende of his purpose, hee began with sharpe wordes in
presence of the nobilitie to disclose his discontented minde, and the
grudge which he bare to Ariobarzanes: on the other syde the king
suborned diuers persons diligently to espy what he saide and did.
Ariobarzanes hearing the king’s sharpe wordes of rebuke, and stimulated
by the persuasion of diuers flatterers, which were hired for that
purpose, after he perceiued that his declared pacience, that his modest
talke and his long and faithful seruice, which he had done to the king,
his losse and hinderance sustained, the perill of his life, which so
many tymes he had suffred preuayled nothing, at length vanquished with
disdayne he brake the bridle of pacience, and sorted out of the boundes
of his wonted nature, for that in place of honoure he receiued rebuke,
and in stede of reward was depryued of his office, began in a rage to
complayne on the king, terminge him to bee an vnkynd prince, which among
the Persians was estemed a worde of great offence to the maiesty:
wherefore faine he would haue departed the court, and retired home to
his countrey, which he could not doe without speciall licence from the
king, and yet to craue the same at his handes, his heart would not serue
him. Al these murmures and complaintes which he secretly made, were
tolde the king, and therefore the king commaunded him one day, to be
called beefore him, vnto whome he sayd: “Ariobarzanes, youre grudging
complaintes and enuious quarels, whyche you
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page186" id = "page186">186</a></span>
brute behinde my backe throughout my Courte, and your continuall rages
outragiously pronounced, through the very Windowes of my Palace haue
pierced mine eares, whereby I vnderstand that thing which hardly I would
haue beleued: but yet being a Prince aswell inclined to fauoure and
quiet hearinge of all causes, as to credite of light reportes, would
faine know of you the cause of your complaints, and what hath moued you
therevnto: for you be not ignorant, that to murmure at the Persian king,
or to terme him to be vnkinde, is no lesse offence than to blaspheme the
Gods immortall, bicause by auncient Lawes and Decrees they be honored
and worshipped as Gods. And among all the penaltyes conteyned in our
lawes, the vyce of Ingratitude is moste bytterlye corrected. But leauing
to speake of the threates and daungers of our lawes, I&nbsp;pray you to
tell me wherin I haue offended you: for albeit that I am a king, yet
reason persuadeth me, not to giue offence to anye man, which if I should
doe (and the Gods forbid the same) I&nbsp;ought rather to be termed a
tyrante than a Kinge.” Ariobarzanes hearing the king speake so
reasonably, was abashed, but yet with stoute countenaunce he feared not
particularly to remember the woordes which he had spoken of the king,
and the cause wherefore he spake them. “Wel (said the king)
I&nbsp;perceiue that you blush not at the words, ne yet feare to reherse
the same vnto my face, wherby I do perceiue and note in you a certayne
kind of stoutenes which naturally procedeth from the greatnes of your
mynd. But yet wisdome would that you should consider the reason and
cause why I haue depryued you from your office. Do you not know that it
appertaineth vnto me in all myne affaires and deedes to be liberal,
curtious, magnificent, and bounteous? Be not those the virtues that make
the fame of a Prince to glister among his subiectes, as the Sunne beames
doe vpon the circuit of the world? Who oughte to rewarde wel doers and
recompence ech wight whiche for any trauell haue al the dayes of their
lyfe, or els in some perticuler seruice vsed their endeuor, or
aduentured the peril of their life, but I alone being your soueraygne
Lord and Prince? To the vertuous and obedient, to the Captayne and the
Souldiour, to the pollityke and to the learned and graue, finally, to
ech wel deseruing wight, I&nbsp;know how to vse the noble princely
vertues of curtesie and liberality. They be the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page187" id = "page187">187</a></span>
comly ensignes of a kynge. They be the onely ornaments of a prince. They
be my perticular vertues. And will you Ariobarzanes, being a valiaunt
Souldioure, a&nbsp;graue counsayler, and a pollityke personage, goe
about to dispossesse me of that which is myne? Wil you whiche are my
seruaunte and Subiecte of whome I make greateste accompt and haue in
dearest estimation, vpon whom I did bestow the greatest dignity within
the compas of my whole Monarchie, grate benefite at my handes, by
abusinge those vertues whiche I aboue other do principally regard? You
do much abuse the credite which I repose in youre greate wisedome. For
hee in whome I thought to fynde most graue aduise, and deemed to bee a
receptacle of al good counsel, doth seeke to take vppon him the
personage of his Prince, and to vsurpe the kinglye qualitie which
belongeth only vnto him. Shal I be tyed by your desertes, or bound by
curteous deedes, or els be forced to rendre recompence? No, no, so long
as this imperiall crowne shal rest on royal head, no subiect by any
curteous deede of his, shal straine vnwilling mynde, which mente it not
before. Tel me I beseech you what reward and gift, what honour and
preferment haue I euer bestowed vpon you, sithens my first arriual to
this victorious raigne, that euer you by due desert did bynde me
thereunto? Which if you did, then liberal I cannot be termed, but a
slauish Prince bound to do the same, by subiects merite. High and
mightie kinges doe rewarde and aduaunce their men, hauing respect that
their gift or benefite shal exceede deserte, otherwise that preferment
cannot bee termed liberal. The great conquerour Alexander Magnus wan a
great and notable Citie for wealth and spoyle. For the principalitie and
gouernment wherof diuers of his noble men made sute, alleaging their
paynful seruice and bloudy woundes about the getting of the same. But
what did that worthy king? was he moued with the bloudshead of his
captaynes? was he styrred with the valiaunce of his men of warre? was he
prouoked with their earnest sutes? No trulye: But calling vnto him a
poore man, whome by chaunce he found there, to him he gaue that riche
and wealthy citie, and the gouernmente thereof, that his magnificence
and his liberalitie to a person so pore and base, might receiue greatter
fame and estimation: and to declare that the conferred benefyte didde
not
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page188" id = "page188">188</a></span>
proceede of deserte or dutie, but of mere liberalitie, very curtesie,
true munificence and noble disposition, deriued from princely heart and
kinglye nature. Howbeit I speake not this that a faythful seruaunt
should be vnrewarded (a&nbsp;thing very requisite) but to inferre and
proue that reward should excell the merite and seruice of the receiuer.
Now then I say, that you going about by large desert and manifold
curtesie to binde mee to recompence the same, you seeke thy next waye to
cut of the meane whereby I should be liberall. Do not you see that
through your vnaduysed curtesie I am preuented, and letted from myne
accustomed liberalitye, wherewith dayly I was wont to reward my kynde,
louing and loyal seruauntes, to whom if they deserued one talent of
golde, my manner was to geue them two or three: if a thousand crownes by
the yeare, to geue them&nbsp;<span class = "smallroman">V</span>. Do you
not know that when they loked for most rewarde or preferment, the soner
did I honour and aduaunce them? Take heede then from henceforth
Ariobarzanes, that you liue with such prouidence and circumspection as
you may bee knowen to be a seruant, and I reputed (as&nbsp;I&nbsp;am)
for your souerayne Lord and mayster. All Princes in myne opinion requyre
two thinges of theire seruantes, that is to say, fidelity and loue,
which being hadd they care for no more. Therefore he that list to
contende with me in curtesie, shal fynde in the ende that I make smale
accompte of him. And he that is my trusty and faithful seruant,
diligente to execute and do my commaundementes, faythful in my secret
affayres, and duetyfull in his vocation, shal truely witte and most
certaynlye feele that I am both curteous and liberall. Which thou thy
selfe shal wel perceiue, and be forced to confesse that I am the same
manne in dede, for curtesie and liberalitye whom thou indeuorest to
surmount.” Then the king held his peace. Ariobarzanes very reuerentlye
made answear in this manner: “Most noble and victorious Prince, wel
vnderstanding the conceiued grief of your inuincible mind pleaseth youre
sacred maiesty to geue mee leaue to answer for my self, not to aggrauate
or heap your wrath and displeasure (which the Gods forbid) but to
disclose my humble excuse before your maiesty that the same poized with
the equall balance of youre rightful mind, my former attempts may nether
seme presumptuous, ne yet my wel meaning
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page189" id = "page189">189</a></span>
mind, well measured with iustice, ouerbold or malapert. Most humbly
then, prostrate vpon my knees I say that I neuer went about, or else did
think in mind to excede or compare with your infinite and
incomprehensible bounty, but indeuored by al possible means to let your
grace perceiue, and the whole world to know that there is nothing in the
world which I regard so much as your good grace and fauour. And mighty
Ioue graunt that I do neuer fal into so great errour to presume for to
contend with the greatnes of your mynde: which fond desire if my beastly
mynd should apprehend, I&nbsp;myghte be lickned to the man that goeth
aboute to berieue and take away the clerenesse of the Sun, or
brightnesse of the splendant stars. But euer I did thinke it to be my
bounden duety not only of those fortunes goods which by your princely
meanes I do inioy to bee a distributer and large giuer, but also bound
for the profite and aduauncement of your regal crowne and dignitye, and
defence of your most noble person, of mine owne life and bloud to be
both liberall and prodigall. And where your maiesty thinketh that I haue
laboured to compare in curtious dede or other liberall behauiour, no
deede that euer I did, or fact was euer enterprised by me for other
respect, but for to get and continue your more ample fauour and daily to
encrease your loue for that it is the seruant’s part with all his force
and might to aspyre the grace and fauoure of his soueraygne lorde. How
beit (most noble prince) before this tyme I did neuer beleue, nor hard
youre grace confesse, that magnanimity, gentlenes and curtesie, were
vertues worthy of blame and correction, as your maiesty hath very
manifestly done me to vnderstande by wordes seuere, and taunting
checkes, vnworthye for practise of such rare and noble vertues. But how
so euer it bee, whether lyfe or death shal depend vpon this prayse
worthy and honourable purpose, I&nbsp;meane hereafter to yeld my dutye
to my souerayne lord, and then it may please him to terme my dedes
courteous or liberal or to thinke on my behauiour, what his owne
princely mynde shal deme and iudge.” The king vpon those wordes rose vp
and sayd: “Ariobarzanes, now it is no tyme to continue in further
disputation of this argument, committing the determination and iudgement
herof, to the graue deliberation of my counsel who at conuenient leasure
aduisedly shal
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page190" id = "page190">190</a></span>
according to the Persian lawes and customes conclud the same. And for
this present time I say vnto thee that I am disposed to accompt the
accusation made agaynste thee to be true, and confessed by thy self. In
the mean tyme thou shalt repayre into the country and come no more to
the court til I commaund thee.” Ariobarzanes receiuinge this answeare of
his souerayne lorde departed, and to his great contentation, went home
into his countreye merye, for that he should be absent out of the daylye
sight of his enemies, yet not wel pleased for that the king had remitted
his cause to his Councell. Neuerthelesse minded to abyde and suffer al
Fortune, he gaue him selfe to the pastime of huntinge of Deere, runninge
of the wylde Bore, and flying of the Hauke. This noble Gentleman had two
onlye daughters of his wife that was deceased, the most beautiful
Gentlewomen of the countrey, the eldest of which two was peerelesse and
without comparison, older than the other by one yeare. The beauty of
those fayre ladies was bruted throughout the whole Region of Persia, to
whome the greatest Lordes and Barons of the countrey were great and
importunate suters. He was not in his countrey resiant the space of
fower monethes, which for salubritie of ayre was most holsome and
pleasaunt, full of lordlike liberties and Gentlemanlike pastimes, aswel
to bee done by the hound as folowed by the spaniell, but one of the
kinge’s Haraulds sente from the Court, appeared before him with message
to this effecte, saying vnto him: “My lord, Ariobarzanes, the kinge my
souerayne Lord hath commaunded you to send with me to the Court the
fayrest of your two daughters, for that the reporte of their famous
beautie hath made him hardlie to beleeue them to be such, as common
bruite would fayne doe him to vnderstand.” Ariobarzanes not well able to
conceiue the meaning of the king’s commaundiment, reuolued in his mynde
diuers thinges touching that demaund, and concludinge vpon one which fel
to his remembrance, determined to send his younger daughter, which
(as&nbsp;we haue sayde before) was not in beautie comparable to her
elder sister, whereupon hee caused the mayden to be sent for, and sayde
vnto her these wordes: “Daughter, the king my maister and thy soueraigne
Lord, hath by his messanger commaunded me to sende vnto him the fayrest
of my daughters, but
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page191" id = "page191">191</a></span>
for a certaine reasonable respect which at thys time I purpose not to
disclose, my mynde is that thou shalt goe, praying thee not to say but
that thou thyselfe art of the twayne the fayrest, the concealinge of
whiche mine aduise wil breede vnto thee (no&nbsp;doubt) thy great
aduauncement, besides the profite and promotion that shal accriue by
that thy silence: and the disclosing of the same may hap to engendre to
thy deere father his euerlasting hindrance, and perchaunce the
depriuation of his lyfe: but if so be the Kinge doe beget the with
childe, in anye wise keepe close the same: and when thou seest thy belly
begin to swell, that no longer it can be closely kept, then in
conuenient time, when thou seest the kinge merily disposed, thou shalt
tell the king that thy syster is far more beautifull than thyselfe, and
that thou art the yonger sister.” The wise maiden well vnderstanding her
father’s minde, and conceiuing the summe of his intent, promised to
performe his charge, and so with the Haraulde and honorable traine, he
caused his daughter to be conueyed to the Court. An easie matter it was
to deceiue the king in the beauty of that maiden: for although the elder
daughter was the fairest, yet this Gentlewoman seemed so peerelesse in
the Courte, that without comparison she was the most beautifull that was
to be found either in Courte or countrey: the behauiour and semblance of
whiche two daughters were so like, that hard it was to iudge whether of
them was the eldest: for their father had so kept them in, that seldome
they were seene within his house, or at no time marked when they walked
abroade. The wife of the king was dead the space of one yeere before,
for which cause he determined to mary the daughter of Ariobarzanes, who
although she was not of the royall bloud, yet of birth she was right
noble. When the kinge sawe this Gentlewoman, he iudged hir to be the
fairest that euer he saw or heard of by report, whom in the presence of
his noblemen he solemnly did marry, and sent vnto her father to appoynct
the Dowry of his married Daughter out of hande, and to returne the same
by that messenger. When Ariobarzanes hearde tell of thys vnhoped
mariage, right ioyfull for that successe, sent vnto his Daughter the
Dowry which he had promised to geue to both his Daughters. Many of the
Court did maruell, that the kynge beinge in aged
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page192" id = "page192">192</a></span>
yeares woulde mary so yongue a mayden, specially the daughter of his
Subiect, whom he had banished from the Courte. Some praysed the kinge’s
Disposition for taking hir whom he fansied: ech man speakynge his
seuerall mynde accordynge to the dyuers customes of men.
Notwythstandinge there were diuers that moued the kinge to that mariage,
thereby to force him to confesse, that by takinge of the goods of
Ariobarzanes, he might be called Courteous and Liberall. The mariage
being solemnized in very sumptuous and princely guise, Ariobarzanes sent
to the kinge the like Dowry which before he had sent him for mariage of
his daughter, with message to this effect: That for so mutch as hee had
Assigned to his Daughters two certayne Dowries to mary them to their
equal feeres, and seeinge that hee which was without exception, was the
husbande of the one, his duety was to bestow vpon his grace a more
greater gift, than to any other which should haue bene his sonne in law:
but the king would not receiue the increase of his dowry, deeming
himselfe wel satisfied with the beauty and good condicions of his new
spouse, whom he entertayned and honored as Queene. In the meane time she
was with childe with a Sonne (as&nbsp;afterwardes in the birth it
appeered) which so wel as she coulde she kept close and secret, but
afterwardes perceiuinge her Belly to wax bigge, the greatnesse whereof
she was not able to hide, beinge vppon a time with the kinge and in
familiar disporte, she like a wise and sobre lady induced matter of
diuers argument, amonges which as occasion serued, she disclosed to the
king, that she was not the fayrest of hir father’s daughters, but hir
elder sister more beautifull than she. The king hearing that, was
greatly offended with Ariobarzanes, for that he had not accomplished his
commaundement: and albeit hee loued well his wife, yet to attaine the
effect of his desire, he called his Haraulde vnto him, whom he had first
sent to make request for his wyfe, and with him returned agayne his new
maried spouse vnto her father, commaunding him to say these wordes:
“That for so mutch as he knew himselfe to be vanquished and ouercome by
the king’s humanity, his grace did maruell, that in place of curtesie,
he would use such contumacy and disobedience, by sending vnto him, not
the fairest of his daughters, which he required, but sutch
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page193" id = "page193">193</a></span>
as he himselfe liked to sende: a&nbsp;matter no doubt worthy to be
sharpely punished and reuenged: for which cause the kinge beinge not a
litle offended, had sent home his daughter agayne, and willed hym to
sende his eldest daughter, and that he had returned the Dowry which he
gaue with his yonger.” Ariobarzanes receyued his daughter and the dowry
with willinge minde, and sayd theese words to the Harauld: “Mine other
daughter which the king my Soueraygne Lord requireth, is not able
presently to go with thee, bycause in hir bed she lieth sicke, as thou
mayst manifestly perceiue if thou come into hir chamber: but say vnto
the king, that vppon my fayth and allegiaunce so soone as she is
recouered, I&nbsp;will sende hir to the court.” The Haraulde seeing the
mayden lye sicke on her bed, weake and Impotent, not able to trauel,
returned to the king, and told him of the sicknesse of the eldest
Daughter of Ariobarzanes, wherewithall beinge satisfied, he attended the
successe of his desired sute: the Gentlewoman no sooner beinge
recouered, but the tyme of the other’s childbirth was come, which
brought forth a goodly Boy: both the Mother safely brought to Bed, and
the childe strong and lusty. Whych greatly contented and pleased
Ariobarzanes, and the greater grew his ioy thereof, for that hee sawe
the Childe to be like vnto the kinge his father: and by that time the
yong Gentlewoman was rysen from her childbed, the sister was perfectly
whole, and had recouered her former hiewe and beauty, both which beinge
richely apparelled, Ariobarzanes with an honourable trayne, sent vnto
the kinge, instructinge them first what they ought to say and do. When
they were arriued at the courte, one of the pryuy chamber aduertised the
king that Ariobarzanes had not onely sent one of his daughters, but both
of them. The kynge hearinge and seeinge the liberalyty of Ariobarzanes,
accepted the same in gracious part, and determined for that curtesie, to
vse him with sutch princely liberality, as he should be forced to
confesse himselfe ouercome. And before the messanger which had brought
the yong gentlewoman did departe, he caused to be called before him his
only sonne called Cyrus, vnto whom he sayd: “Bycause Cyrus the time of
thy yeares bee sutch, as meete they be to match the in Mariage, for hope
I haue to see some Progeny proceede of thee before I die,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page194" id = "page194">194</a></span>
my minde is that thou shalt mary this goodly Gentlewoman here, the
syster of my Wyfe.<ins class = "addition" title =
"close quote missing">”</ins> To which hys father’s hest, the yong gentleman
willingly assented. Then the kyng toke again his owne, and ordayned a
royall feast, for the mariage of his Sonne, which was celebrated and
done with great triumph and solemnity, continuinge the space of 8 dayes.
Ariobarzanes hearinge these good newes, would not yet acknowledge
himselfe to be ouercome, and seeinge that his purpose was nowe brought
to an extremity, determined to send the little childe, a&nbsp;little
before begotten of hys daughter, to the kinge, which so resembled the
kinge’s face and Countenaunce as was possible: and therefore caused a
cradle to bee made of the fairest Iuory that was to be gotten, embossed
and garnished with pure Golde, adorned and set wyth most precious Stones
and Iewels, wherein he caused the childe to be placed, and couered wyth
rich clothes of fynest gold and silke, and together with the Nourice,
accompanied with a pompous trayne of Gentlemen, he sent him to the
kinge, the very time that the solemne mariage should be celebrated: and
the kinge beinge in his great Hall, which was hanged with maruellous
rich and costly Arras, attended vpon with a great numbre of his Barons
and noble men, hee that had the charge of the conduction of the child,
vpon his knees presented the same before him, lyinge in the Cradle. The
king and the Noblemen, meruelling what that did meane expected what the
Messenger would say, who holding the Cradle by one of the Pomels, sayd
these wordes: “Most renoumed and victorious Prince, in the behalfe of
Ariobarzanes, my Lorde and your Subiect, most humbly I present vnto your
maiesty, with al Submission and reuerence, this gift: and my sayd Lord
doth rendre infinite thankes vnto your highnesse, for the great curtesie
it hath pleased you to vse, by vouchsafinge to entertayne him into your
alliaunce: for which not to seeme vnmindfull, this present (and
therewithall he opened the Cradle) by mee hee hath sent vnto your
maiesty.” When the Cradle was discouered, there apeared a goodly yong
Chylde, Smilinge and Laughing vpon his father, the ioyfullest sight that
euer his father sawe, and so like vnto him, as the halfe Moone is lyke
the proportion of the rest. Then euery of the Standers by began to say
his minde touchinge the resemblaunce of the Chylde
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page195" id = "page195">195</a></span>
to hys Father, hardily protesting the same without doubt to be his owne.
The kyng could not be satisfied with the sight of his child, by reason
of the great delight he had to looke vpon him, and of the generall
opinion whych all men auouched touchinge his lykenesse. The Chylde
agayne vpon the common reioyce made vpon hym, but specially of hys
Father, wyth preaty motions and sweete laughinges, representinge two
smilinge pyttes in his ruddy Cheekes, crowed many tymes vpon his father,
toyinge vp and downe hys tender handes: afterwardes the kynge behelde
the workmanship of that sumptuous cradle, and demaunded whereof the
substaunce was. Vnto whom the Messenger discribed the Hystory and whole
content of that incomparable Iewel: who hearinge that discourse, caused
the Queene to be called forth, and by her was further certified of her
father’s noble disposition, wyth exceeding contentation, and wonderfull
reioyce, he receyued the little Chylde, and confessed hym selfe in maner
vanquished: notwythstandinge seeming to be thus surmounted, he thought
if he did not surpasse this curtesy, his noble and princely minde should
be disgraced: wherefore he determined to vse a kind of magnanimity,
thereby eyther to ouercome Ariobarzanes, or else hauinge apparant
occasion altogether to fall out and to conceyue a mortall malice agaynst
hym. The Kynge had a Daughter of the age of 21 yeares, a&nbsp;very fayre
and comely Lady (accordinge as her Royall education and princely
bringinge vp required) whom as yet he had not matched in mariage,
meaninge to bestowe her vppon some kynge or great Monarch with a dowry
of Ten hundred thousand Crownes, besides the pryncely and great costly
Apparell and Iewells whych her owne mother lyinge vppon her death Bed
did bequeathe her. The kynge then purposinge to excell Ariobarzanes,
mynded by couplynge hym wyth hys Daughter, to make hym his sonne in
lawe: whych to a Lady of Royall Linage, appeareth some debacinge of her
noble bloud, to be matched with a man of inferiour byrth: the lyke to a
Man how honourable so euer he be cannot chaunce, if he take a Wyfe of
Degree neuer so Base: for if hee bee borne of Noble and Gentle kynde,
hee doth illustrate and aduaunce the Woman whom he taketh, all be it
shee were of the meanest trampe of the popular sorte, and the Chyldren
whych be borne of them
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page196" id = "page196">196</a></span>
by the Father’s meanes, shalbe Noble and of a gentle kynd: but a woman,
although shee be most Noble, if shee bee married to hir inferiour, and
that hir husbande bee not so Noble, the chyldren that shall be borne of
them shall not receiue the honour of the mother’s stock, but the state
of the father’s lotte, and so shall be vnnoble. Sutch is the Reuerence
and Authoritie of the Sexe of man, wherevpon doeth ryse the comparyson
of the wyfe, which doth resemble the man vnto the Sunne, and the Woman
to the Moone. For wee see that the Moone of hir selfe doth not giue
light, ne yet can yelde any brightnesse to the darknesse of the Night,
if she did not pertake some shining of the Sun, who with his liuely
flames at times and places doth brighten the starres, and maketh the
moone to shine: euen so the woman dependeth of the man, and of hym doth
take hir nobility. The kyng therefore thought the match not meete for
Ariobarzanes to marry his Daughter, and feared he should incurre some
blemish of his house: but for all respect and feare of shame, the
emulation whyche hee had to be victorious of his forced curtesie did
surpasse. Wherefore he sent for Ariobarzanes to come vnto the Court: who
vpon that commaundement came: and so soone as hee was entered the
palace, he repayred to do his reuerence vnto the kinge, of whom he was
welcomed with glad and ioyfull entertaynement: and after they had a
whyle debated of diuers matters, the kyng sayd vnto him: “Ariobarzanes,
for so mutch as thou art without a wyfe, we minde to bestowe vpon thee a
Gentlewoman, which not onely wee well like and loue, but also is sutch a
one, as thou thy selfe shalt be well contented to take.” Ariobarzanes
aunswered: That he was at his commaundement: and that sutch choyse as
pleased his maiesty, should very well content and satisefie him. Then
the kyng caused his daughter, in riche vestures sumptuously attired to
come before him, and there openly in presence of the whole Court
commaunded that Ariobarzanes should marry her: which with seemely
ceremonies being consummate, Ariobarzanes shewed little ioy of the
parentage, and in apparance made as though he cared not for his wyfe.
The Nobles and Gentlemen of the Courte wondred to see the straunge
behauiour of the bridegroome, consideringe the great humanity of their
Prince towardes his Subject, by takinge him for
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page197" id = "page197">197</a></span>
his Father, and Sonne in lawe: and greatly murmured to see the obstinacy
and rudenesse of Ariobarzanes, towards the kynge and the Fayre newe
maried Spouse, mutch blaminge and rebukinge hys vnkinde demeanour.
Ariobarzanes that day fared as though hee were besides himselfe, voyde
of ioy and mirth, where all the rest of the Courte spent the tyme in
sport and Triumph, the Ladies and Noble women together with the kynge
and Queene themselues<ins class = "correction" title = ". for ,">.
</ins>dauncinge and maskinge, vntil the time of night did force ech
Wyghte to Retyre to their Chaumbers. Notwithstandinge the kynge did
marke the Gesture and Countenaunce of Ariobarzanes, and after the Banket
the Kynge in Solempne guise and great Pompe caused hys Daughter to bee
accompanyed wyth a great Trayne to the Lodginge of Ariobarzanes, and to
be caried with hir, hir Pryncely Dowry, where Ariobarzanes very
Honourably receyued hys Wyfe, and at that Instant, in the presence of
all the Noblemen and Barons that wayted vpon the Bride, hee doubled the
Dowry receyued, and the same wyth the Ten hundred thousand Crownes geuen
hym by the kynge, hee sent back agayne. This vnmeasured Liberality
seemed passynge Straunge vnto the kynge, and bredde in him sutch
disdayne, as doubtful he was whether to yelde, or to condemne him to
perpetuall Banishment. The kynge thought that the greatnesse of
Ariobarzanes mynde was Inuincible, and was not able paciently to suffer,
that a subiect in matters of curtesie and liberality, should still
compare wyth his king and maister: herewithal the king conceiuing
malice, could not tell what to say or do. An easy matter it was to
perceiue the rage and furie of the king, who was so sore displeased, as
he bare good looke and countenaunce to no man: and bicause in those
dayes the Persian kings were honored and reuerenced as Gods, there was a
lawe that when the king was driuen into a furie, or had conceiued a iust
displeasure, he shoulde manifest vnto his Counsellers, the cause of his
anger, who afterwardes by mature diligence hauing examined the cause and
finding the kinge to be vniustly displeased should seke meanes of his
appeasing: but if they found his anger and displeasure to be iustly
grounded, the cause of the same, according to the quality of the
offence, little or great, they should punish, eyther by banishment or
capital death: the sentence of whom
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page198" id = "page198">198</a></span>
should passe and be pronounced without appeale. Howbeit Lawfull it was
for the Kynge to mitigate the pronounced sentence, eyther in al, or in
part, and to diminish the payne, or clearely to assoyle the party:
whereby it euidently appeared, that the Counsellers Sentence once
determined, was very iustice, and the kynge’s wyll if he pardoned, was
meere grace and mercy. The kyng was constrayned by the statutes of his
kyngdome to disclose vnto his Counsell the cause of his displeasure,
which particularly he recited: the Counsellers when they heard the
reasons of the kynge, sent for Ariobarzanes, of whom by due examination
they gathered, that in diuers causes he had prouoked the kynge’s
dyspleasure. Afterwards the Lords of the Counsell, vpon the proposed
question began to argue, by inuestigation and search whereof, in the
ende they iudged Ariobarzanes worthy to loose hys head: for that he
would not onely compare, but also go about to ouertoppe him in thinges
vndecent, and to shewe himselfe discontented with the mariage of his
daughter, and vnthankfull of the benefites so curteously bestowed vpon
him. A&nbsp;custome was obserued amonge the Persians, that in euery acte
or enterprise, wherein the seruaunt endeuored to surpasse and vanquish
his lord and maister (albeit the attempt were commendable and
prayseworthy) for respect of want of duety, or contempt to the royall
maiesty, he should lose his best ioynt: and for better confirmation of
their iudgement, the Counsellers alleaged a certayne diffinitiue
sentence, regestred in their Chronicles, whilom done by the kyngs of
Persia. The cause was this: one of the kyngs of that Region disposed to
disporte with certayne of his noble men abrode in the Fields, went a
Hauking, and with a Faucon to fly at diuers game. Within a while they
sprang a Hearon, and the Kynge commaunded that one of the faulcons which
was a notable swift and soaring Hauke, should be cast of to the Hearon:
which done, the hearon began to mount and the faucon speedely pursued,
and as the Hauke after many batings and intercourses, was about to seaze
vpon the hearon, he espied an Egle: the stoute Hauke seeing the Egle,
gaue ouer the fearfull Hearon, and with swift flight flewe towardes the
hardy Egle, and fiercely attempted to seaze vpon her: but the Egle very
stoutly defended her selfe, that the Hauke was
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page199" id = "page199">199</a></span>
forced to let goe hir holde. In the ende the good Hauke, with her sharpe
talendes, agayne seazed vpon the Egle’s neck, and wyth her beake strake
her starke dead, wherewithall she fel downe amid the company that wayted
vpon the king. Al the Barons and Gentlemen highly commended and praysed
the Hauke, affirminge that a better was not in the worlde, attributing
vnto the same sutch prayse, as they thought meete. The king for all the
acclamations and shoutes of the troupe, spake not a worde, but stoode
musing with himselfe, and did neyther prayse nor blame the Hauke. It was
very late in the eueninge, when the Faucon killed the Egle, and
therefore the kinge commaunded ech man to depart to the Citty. The next
day the king caused a Goldsmith to make an exceeding fayre crowne of
golde, apt and meete for the Falcon’s head. Afterwards when he saw time
conuenient, he ordayned that in the market place of the Citty,
a&nbsp;Pearche should be erected, and adorned with Tapestry, Arras, and
other costly furnitures, sutch as Prynces Palaces are bedecked withall.
Thither with sound of Trumpets hee caused the Faucon to be conueyed,
where the kinge commaunded one of his noble men to place the Crowne vpon
his head, for price of the excellent pray atchieued vpon the Egle. Then
he caused the hangman or common executioner of the Citty, to take the
Crowne from the Faucon’s head, and with the trenchant sword to cut it
of. Vppon these contrary effectes the beholders of this sight were
amazed, and began diuersly to talk thereof. The king which at a window
stoode to behold this fact, caused silence to be kept, and so opened his
princely voice, as he was wel heard speaking these words: “There ought
(good people) none of you all to Murmur and grudge at the present fact
executed upon the Faucon, bycause the same is done vppon good reason and
iust cause as by processe of my discourse you shall well perceiue.
I&nbsp;am persuaded that it is the office and duety of euery magnanimous
prince, to know the valor and difference betweene vertue and vice, that
all vertuous actes and worthy attempts may be honoured, and the contrary
chastised and punished, otherwise he is not worthy of the name of a Kyng
and Prynce, but of a cruel and trayterous Tyrant: for as the prince
beareth the title by principality and chiefe, so ought his life chiefly
to excell other, whom he gouerneth and ruleth. The
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page200" id = "page200">200</a></span>
bare title and dignity is not sufficient, if his conditions and
moderation be not to that supreme state equiualent. Full well I knew and
did consider to be in this dead Faucon a certayne generosity and
stoutnesse of minde, ioyned wyth a certayne fierce actiuity and
nimblenesse, for which I Crowned and rewarded hir wyth thys golden
Garland, bycause of the stoute slaughter which she made vpon that myghty
Egle, worthy for that solemne guise. But when I considered how boldly
and rashely she assayled and killed the Egle, which is hir Queene and
Maystresse, I&nbsp;thought it a part of Iustice, that for hir bolde and
vncomely act, she shoulde suffer the payne due to hir deserte: for
vnlawful it is for the seruaunte, and vnduetiful for the subiect, to
imbrue his handes in the bloud of his Soueraygne Lord. The Faulcon then
hauinge slayne hir Queene, and of all other Birdes the Soueraygne, who
can with reason blame me for cuttinge of the Faucon’s head? Doubtlesse
none, that hath respect to the quiet state betweene the Prince and
Subiect.” This example the Iudges alleaged against Ariobarzanes when
they pronounced sentence: and applyinge the same to him, ordeyned that
first Ariobarzanes, for his Magnanimity and liberal curtesie should be
Crowned wyth a Laurell Garland, for the generosity of his minde and
exceedinge curtesie, but for his great emulation, earnest endeuour, and
continuall dyuice to contende wyth hys Prynce, and in Liberality to shew
him selfe superior, bysides the mutteringe speech vttered agaynst hym,
his head ought to be striken of. Ariobarzanes beinge aduertised of thys
seuere condemnation, hee purposed to sustayne the Venemous Darte of
Fortune, as hee had endured other bruntes of that Enuious inconstant
Lady, and in sutch maner behaued and directed his Gestes, and
Countenaunce, as no Sygne of Choler or Dyspayre appeared in him, onely
Pronouncinge thys Sentence with ioyfull Cheare in the presence of many:
“Glad I am that at length there resteth in me so mutch to be liberall,
as I employ my life and bloud, to declare the same to my Soueraygne
Lorde, which right willingly I meane to do, that the World may know, how
I had rather lose my lyfe, than to faynt and geue ouer in mine
accustomed liberality.” Then callinge a Notary vnto him, he made his
Wyll (for so it was lawfull by the Persian lawes) and to his Wyfe, and
Daughters hee
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page201" id = "page201">201</a></span>
increased their Dowries, and to his kinsfolke and freendes he bequeathed
diuers rich and bountifull Legacies. To the kyng he gaue a great number
of most precious Iewels. To Cyrus the king’s sonne, and his by mariage
(besides a great masse of money) he bequeathed all his Armure, and
Weapons, with all his instruments for the warres, and his whole stable
of horsse. Last of all he ordayned, that if (perhaps) his wyfe should be
found with chylde, and brought to Bed of a Sonne hee should be his
vniuersall heyre: but if a Woman chylde, to haue the dowry that his
other daughters had. The rest of his goods and cattel he gaue
indifferently to al <span class = "smallroman">III.</span> equally to be
deuided. He prouided also, that all his seruantes accordinge to their
degree, should be rewarded. The day before he should be put to death
(according to the custome of Persia) his prayses and valiaunt factes, as
wel by Epitaphes fixed vpon poasts, as by proclamation, were generally
sounded throughout the Realme, in such wise as ech wight iudged him to
be the most liberall and noble personage that was in all the Countrey,
and in the borders confininge vpon the same. And if there had not bene
some enuious persons nere the kyng, which studied and practised his
ouerthrow, al other would haue deemed him vnworthy of death. Sutch is
enuy of the maliciously disposed, that rather than they would see their
equals to be in better estimation with the prynce than themselues, study
and deuise all pollicy eyther by flattery or false surmise to bringe
them in discredite, or to practise by false accusation, their vtter
subuersion by Death or Banishement. But whiles Ariobarzanes was
disposinge his thinges in order, his Wyfe and Daughters with his Friends
and Cousins, were affected with great sorrow day and night, complayning
for the heauy state of that noble Gentleman. The eight day being come
(for the lawe allowed that space to the condemned, for disposition of
their thynges) a&nbsp;Skaffolde was made by commaundement of the king,
in the middest of the Market place, al couered with black cloth, and an
other right ouer against the same with Purple and Silk, where the kyng
(if&nbsp;he list) in the mids of the Iudges should sit and the
inditement redde, iudgement (by&nbsp;the kynge’s owne mouth declared)
should be executed, or if it pleased him, discharge and assoyle the
condemned. And the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page202" id = "page202">202</a></span>
kynge vnwillinge to be present, gaue to one of the eldest iudges hys
full power and authority. But yet sorrowful that a Gentleman so noble
and valiaunt, his father and sonne in lawe, should finish his life with
a death so horrible, would needes that morninge be present himselfe at
that execution, as wel to see the continent and stoute ende of
Ariobarzanes, as also to take order for his deliuery. When the time was
come, Ariobarzanes by the Sergeante and Garde was brought vnto the
Skaffolde, and there Aparelled in rich Vestures, the Laurel Crowne was
set on his head, and so continuinge for a certayne space, the garment
and Crowne was taken of agayne together with his other Apparell. The
executioner attendinge for commaundement to do his office, and lifting
vp his sworde to do the fact, the king desired to see the countenaunce
of Ariobarzanes, who neuer chaunged coloure for all that terrour of
death. The king seeing the great constancy and inuincible mind of
Ariobarzanes, spake aloud that all men might heare hym, these wordes:
“Thou knowest Ariobarzanes, that it is not I, which haue wroughte thy
condemnation, ne yet by enuious desyre haue sought thy bloude, to brynge
thee to thys extremity, but it hath bene thy ill disordred life, and the
statutes of this Realme, which haue found thee guilty, and thereupon
sentence and death pronounced, and execution now ready to be done, and
the minister ready to aduaunce his arme, to play the last acte of this
Tragedy: and yet for that our holy lawes doe geue liberty that I may
assoyle and delyuer whom I list, and them restore to their former state,
if nowe thou wilt acknowledge thy selfe vanquished and ouercome, and
accepte thy lyfe in gratefull part, I&nbsp;will pardon thee, and restore
thee to thyne offyces and promotions.” Ariobarzanes, hearying these
wordes, kneeled downe wyth hys heade declyned, and expecting the blow of
the Sworde, lyfted vp himselfe, and turnynge his face to the kinge,
perceyuing his malice not so sore bent against hym as the enuy and
malice of his ennemies desired, he determined to proue and vse the
pitiful liberality and fauour of his Soueraigne Lorde, that his Foes by
his death might not Triumph, ne yet attayne the thinge, for which so
long they aspired. Wherefore in reuerent wyse kneelinge before his
maiesty, with a stout and perfect voyce sayd these words: “Most
vyctorious and mercifull
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page203" id = "page203">203</a></span>
Soueraygne Lord, in equall worship and honour to the immortall Gods,
sith of thy abundant grace and mercy it hath pleased thee to graunt me
lyfe, I&nbsp;do most humbly accept the same, which if I wyst should be
prolonged in thy disgrace and wrath, could not be pleasaunt vnto me, and
therefore do confesse my selfe in curtesie and liberality altogether
surmounted and ouercome. I&nbsp;most humbly then do geue thee thankes
for preseruation of my lyfe, hopinge hereafter to employ the vttermost
of myne endeuour for the benefite and honour of thy Crowne and dignity,
as readyly and without supplication made in my behalfe, thou hast
vouchesafed to restore the same: and sith thy clemency hath reuiued me
thyne humble vassall, I&nbsp;beseech thy maiesty to giue me leaue to say
my minde, trustinge thereby to do thee to vnderstand the effect and
cause of that my former presumption.” The kinge made signes that he
should arise and boldly speake the summe of his desire. When he stoode
up, silence was proclaymed, who then began to speake these wordes: “Two
things there be, (most sacred Prince) which doubtlesse do Resemble the
raging Waues of surginge Seas, and the mutability of vnstable windes,
and yet great is the folly of an infinite numbre, which imploy their
whole care and diligence to the pursute thereof. These two thinges
whereof I speake, and be so deerely beloued of flattering Courtiers, are
the grace and fauour of their soueraygne lord, and the luringe loue of
Amorous Dames: whych two do so often beguyle the courtly gentleman, that
in ende, they engender nought else but repentance: and to begin with the
loue of Ladies, they, as by common experience is proued, most commonly
do recline to their Inferiours. It is dayly seene by to mutch vnhappy
proofe, that a yongue Gentleman by Byrth noble, and otherwyse riche,
vertuous, and indued with many goodly gyfts, shall choose and worship
one for his soueraigne Lady and maistresse, and her shall serue and
honour with no lesse fayth and fidelity then is due to the immortall
Gods, and shal not sticke to employ for her loue and seruice all the
possible power and trauell he is able to do, and yet she in dispite of
all his humble endeuour, shall imbrace an other voide of all vertue,
makynge him possessor of that benefite, after which the other seeketh,
and shee not longe constant in that minde, afterwards wil attend to the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page204" id = "page204">204</a></span>
first Suter, but in sutch mouable and disdaynfull sort, as the wandring
starres (through their natural instability) be moued to and fro, and him
in the ende will suffre to fall headlong into the bottomlesse pit of
dispayre: and to him that asketh hir the reason of this variety, she
maketh none other aunswere but that her pleasure is sutch, and wilfull
will to dally with her sutors: so that seldome times a true and perfit
louer can fasten his foote on certayne holde, but that his life is
tossed vp and downe like the whirling blastes of inconstant windes. The
like succedeth in the Courtes of Kings and Princes, he which is in
fauoure with his soueraigne Lord in al mens eyes, so great and neare, as
it seemeth the Prince is disposed to resolue vpon nothing without his
aduise and counsell, when such fauored person shall employe his whole
care and industrie to maintaine and encrease the commenced grace of his
soueraigne Lord, behold, vpon the sodaine the minde and vaine of his
Lord is changed, and an other without desert, which neuer carked to win
good will, is taken in place, cherished as though hee had serued him an
hundred yeares before: and he that was the first minion of the Courte in
greatest grace and estimation, is in a moment dispysed, and oute of all
regarde: an other within fewe dayes after, shall supplie the place of
the other twaine, verye dyligent and careful to serue a man trained vp
in courtly exercise, whose mindfull mind shall bee so caring ouer his
lord’s affayers, as vpon the safegard and preseruation of his owne life:
but all his labour is employed in vayne: and when the aged dayes of his
expired life approch, for the least displeasure he shalbe thrust out
without reward for former trauel, that right aptly the Common Prouerb
may be applied: the common Courtier’s life is like a golden misery, and
the faithfull seruant an Asse perpetuall. I&nbsp;haue seene my selfe the
right wel learned man to sterue in Court for want of meate, and a
blockish beast voyde of vertue, for lust, and for merite, aduaunced and
made a Gentleman: but this may chaunce bicause hys Lord is not disposed
to vertue, nought esteeminge those that be affected with good sciences,
and that onely for lacke of carefull trayninge vp in youthfull dayes, or
else for that his minde cannot frame with gentle spyrits, the closets of
whose breasts be charged and fraught with infinite loades of learninge,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page205" id = "page205">205</a></span>
and haue not bin noseled in trade of Courtes, ne yet can vse due courtly
speech, or with vnblushinge face can shuffle themselues in presence of
their betters, or commen with Ladies of dame Venus toyes: or race of
birth not mingled with the noble or gentle Sire: for these causes
perhaps that vertuous wighte cannot attain the hap of fortune’s giftes.
Which person thoughe in Court he be not esteemed, yet in schoolehouse of
good arte he is deemed famouse, and for his worthy skill right worthy to
be preferred aboue the heauens. In semblable wise, how oftentimes and
commonly is it seene that the man perchance which neuer thou sawest
before, so sone as he is seene of the, sodaynly he is detested lyke a
plague, and the more earnest he is to do the seruice and pleasure, the
greater is thy wrath bent towards him? Contrarywise, som other vpon the
first view shal so content and please the, as if he require the
bestowing of thy life, thou hast no power to denie him, thou arte in
loue with him, and let him thwart thy mind and wil neuer so much, thou
carest not for it, all is well he doth: but that these varieties do
proceede from some certayn temprement of bloud within the body conformed
and moued by som inward celestial power, who doubteth? And surely the
foundation of these Courtly mutations, is the pricking venomous Goade of
pestiferous Enuye, whych continually holdeth the fauour of Prynces in
ballaunce, and in a moment hoisteth vp him which was below, and poizeth
downe agayne him that was exalted: so that no plague or poison is more
pestiferous in Courts, than the hurtfull disease of Enuy: all other
vices with little paine and lesse labour may easily be cured, and so
pacified as they shall not hurt thee: but rooted Enuy by any meanes is
discharged, with no pollicye is expelled, ne yet by any Drugge or
medicine purged. Veryly wythout great daunger, I&nbsp;know not which way
the poynaunt bittes of Enuy can be auoyded: the proude man in Courte,
the arrogant and ambitious, the lofty minded Foole, more eleuate and
lustie than Pride it selfe, if reverence bee done to him, if he be
honoured, if place be giuen to him, if hee be praysed and glorified
aboue the heauens, if thou humble thy selfe to him, by and by he will
take thee to be his frend, and wyll deeme thee to bee a curteous and
gentle companion. Let the lacyuious and wanton person giuen to the
pleasures and lust
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page206" id = "page206">206</a></span>
of women, fixing his mind on nothing else but vpon fugitiue pleasures,
if his loue bee not impeached, ne yet his wanton toyes reproued, if he
be praysed before his Ladie, he will euer be thy friend: the couetous
and gloutonous carle, if first thou make hym quaffe a Medicine, and
afterwardes byd hym to thy table, the one and other disease is speedily
cured: but for the enuious person, what Phisicke can be sought to purge
his pestiferous humour? which if thou go about to heale and cure, rather
muste thou remedye the same by wasting the life of him that is so
possessed, than find causes of recouerie. And who knoweth not (most
sacred Prince) that in your Courte there be some attached with that
poisoned plague, who seeing me your maiestie’s humble vassall in greater
fauoure with your grace than they, my seruice more acceptable than
theirs, my prowesse and exercise in armes more worthy than theirs, my
diligence more industrious than theirs, my advise and counsell more
auayleable than theirs, all mine other deedes and doings in better
Estimation than theirs: they I say, dallied in the lap of the cancred
witch dame Enuy, by what meanes are they to be recouered? by what meanes
their infection purged? by what meanes their mallice cured? If not to
see me depriued of your grace, expelled from your Court, and cast
headlonge into the gulfe of death extreme? If I should bribe them with
great rewardes, if I should honour them with humble reuerence, if I
should exalt them aboue the Skyes, if I should employ the vttermost of
my power, to do them seruice, all frustrate and cast away: they wil not
cease to bring me into perill, they will not spare to reduce me to
misery, they will not sticke to ymagin all deuyses for myne anoyance,
when they see al other remdyes impotent and vnable: this is the poisoned
plague which enuenometh all Princes courtes: this is the mischiefe which
destroyeth all kyngdomes: this is the monster that deuoureth all
vertuous enterpryses and offendeth eche gentle spirite: this is the dim
vale which so ouershadoweth the clerenes of the eyes as the bright beams
of verity cannot be sene, and so obscureth the equity of iustice, as
right from falshode cannot be discerned: this is the manifest cause that
breadeth a thousand errors in the workes of men: and to draw nere to the
effecte of this my tedious talke,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page207" id = "page207">207</a></span>
briefly, there is no vice in the worlde that more outragiously
corrupteth Princes courtes, that more vnfrendly vntwineth frendship’s
band, that more vnhappely subuerteth noble houses, then the poysone of
Enuy: for he that enclineth his eares to the enuious person, he that
attendeth to his malignant deuises, vnpossible it is for him to do any
dede that is eyther good or vertuous: but to finishe and end for
auoyding of wearines and not to stay your maiesty from your waighty
affayres, I&nbsp;say that the enuyous man reioiceth not so much in his
own good turnes nor gladdeth himself so greatlye with his owne
commodityes, as hee doth insulte, and laugh at the discommodityes and
hinderance of others, at whose profite and gain he soroweth and
lamenteth: and to put out both the eyes of his companion, the enuious
man careth not to plucke out one of his own. These wordes (most
inuincible prince) I&nbsp;purposed to speake in the presence of your
maiesty, before your gard and courtlyke train, and in the vniuersal
hearing of all the people that ech wighte may understand how I not of
your maiestie’s pretended malice, or mine owne committed faulte, but
through the venemous tongues of the enuious fel into the lapse of your
displeasure.” This moste true oration of Ariobarzanes greatly pleased
the noble Prince, and although he felt himself somwhat touched therwith,
and knowing it to bee certayn and true and that in tyme to come the same
mighte profite all sortes of people, hee greatlye praised and exalted
him in the presence of all the assembly. Wherefore Ariobarzanes having
recouered his lyfe confessed himselfe to bee vanquished and ouercome by
the king, who knowing the valoure and fealty of that noble Gentleman,
and louing him with harty affection, caused him to come down from the
mourning Scaffolde, and to assend the place where he was himselfe, whom
he imbraced and kissed, in token that al displeasure was remitted: all
his auncient offices were restored to him agayne: and for his further
aduancement, he gaue him the Cittye of Passagarda where was the olde
monument of kinge Cyrus, and made him lieuetenaunt generall of his
realmes and dominions, commaundinge euery of his subiects to obay him as
himselfe. And so the kyng rested the honourable father in law to
Ariobarzanes, and his louinge sonne by mariage crauing stil in al his
enterpryses,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page208" id = "page208">208</a></span>
his graue aduyse and counsell: and there was neuer thing of any
importance done, but his liking or disliking was firste demaunded:
Ariobarzanes then returned into greater grace and fauour of his
souerayne lord than before, and for his singular vertue hauing disperced
and broken the aimes and malyce of all his enimies, if before he were
curteous and liberal after these so stoute aduentures, he became more
then princely in his dedes, and if sometymes he had done one curteous
act now he doubled the same. But sutch was his Magnanimitye, so noble
were his indeuors, tempred with such measure and equanimity, as the
whole worlde clerely might deserne, that not to contend with his
souerayne lorde but to honour and serue him, therby to expresse the
maiestye of his Prince, he employed his goodes and liuing al which the
kinge and fortune had bountifully bestowed vppon him: who vntil his
dying day famously mayntayned himselfe in the good grace and fauour of
his prince, in such wyse as the kyng more clerely then the shining
Sunnebeames, knew Ariobarzanes to bee framed of nature for a
christalline mirrour of curtesie and liberalitye, and that more easie it
was to bereiue the fyre of heate, and the Sonne of lighte then despoyle
Ariobarzanes of his glorious dedes. Wherfore he ceassed not continually
to honour, exalt and enrych him, that hee might vse the greater
liberality, and to say the treuth, althoughe these two vertues of
curtesie and Liberality be commendable in all persons, without the which
a man truely is not he whereof hee beareth the name yet very fitting and
meete for euerye ryche and welthie subiect, to beware how he doth
compare in those noble vertues with Princes and great men, which beyng
ryght noble and pereles vppon yearth canne abyde no Comparisons.</p>

if it deserue to be called loue, and not the rather, as the end ful wel
declared, a&nbsp;most filthy and beastly lust: this Lucius was deerly
beloued of Aristotemus, for the fiendish resemblance and wicked
nerenesse of his vile and abhominable condicions: and therfore feared
and obeied as the Tyrante’s owne person: for which cause this Lucius
sent one of the yeomen of the kinge’s chamber to commaunde Philodemus at
an appoynted hour, al excuses set apart, to bring his daughter vnto him.
The parentes of the mayden hearing this sodayne and fearful mesuage,
constrayned by Tyrante’s forse and fatal necessity, after many tears and
pittious sighes, began to perswade their daughter to be contented to goe
with him, declaringe vnto her the rigour of the magistrate that had
sente for hir the extremety that would be executed, and that ther was no
other remedy but to obay. Alas, how sore agaynst their willes, with what
trembling gesture, with what horror the good parentes of this tender
pusill were affected, to consider the purpose of that dreadefull
message, all dere fathers and naturall mothers can tell. But this gentle
mayden Micca which was of nature stoute, and yet vertuously lessoned
with sundry good and holsome instructions from hir Infante’s Age was
Determined rather to Dye, then to suffer her selfe to be Defloured. This
vertuous Mayden fell downe Prostrate at her Father’s Feet, and clasping
him fast about the Knees, louingly did pray him, and Pitifully besought
him, not to suffer hir to bee haled to so filthy and vile an office, but
rather with the piercing blade of a two edged sword to kill her, that
therby she might be rid from the violation of those fleshly and
libidinous varlets, saying, that if her virginity were taken from hir,
she should liue in eternal reproch and shame. As the father and daughter
were in these termes, Lucius for the long tariance and delaye, dronke
with the Wine of lechery, made impacient and furious, with cursed speede
posted to the house of Philodemus, and finding the maiden prostrate at
her father’s feete weeping, her head in his lappe with taunting voice
and threatning woordes commaunded presently without longer delay she
should ryse and go with him: She refusing his hasty request, and crying
out for Father’s help, who (God wot) durst not resist, stoode still and
would not goe: Lucius seeing hir refusal ful of furie and proude
disdaine, began furiously
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page211" id = "page211">211</a></span>
to hale hir by the garments, vpon whose struggling he tare hir kirtle
and furnitures of hir head and shoulders, that hir alablaster necke and
bosome appeared naked, and without compassion tare and whipte hir flesh
on euery side, as the bloud ranne downe, beating that tendre flesh of
hirs with manifold and greuous blowes. O&nbsp;vile tirant, more wood and
sauage than the desert beast or mountaine Tigre: could cruelty be so
deepely rooted in the hart of man which by nature is affected with
reason’s instinct, as without pity to lay handes, and violently to hurt
the tendre body of a harmlesse Maidee? Can such inhumanity harbor in any
that beareth aboute him the shape of man? But what did this martyred
maiden for all this force? Did she yeld to violence, or rendre hir self
to the disposition of this mercilesse man? No surely. But with so great
stoutnesse of mind, she suffred those impressed wounds, that no one word
sounding of sorrow, or womanly shriech was heard to sound from hir
delicate mouth: howbeit the pore father and miserable mother at that
rueful and lamentable sight, moued with inward grief and natural pity,
cried out aloude. But when they sawe that neyther playnt nor fayre
speech coulde deliuer their Daughter out of the hands of that cruell
monster, they began with open cryes and horrible exclamation to implore
helpe and succour at the handes of the immortall Gods, thinking that
they were vnworthely plaged and tormented. Then the proud and most
barbarous wretch, moued and disquieted by cholers rage and fume of
chafinge Wyne, sodaynly catched the most constant virgin by the hayre of
the head, and in her father’s Lap did cut her white and tender throte.
O&nbsp;detestable fact, right worthy iust reuenge. But what did this
vnfaythfull and cruell Tyrant Aristotimus, when by the blustering bruit
of people’s rage he heard of this vengeable murder, not only he shewed
himselfe contented wyth the fact, but had him in greater regard than
before, and towards them which made complaint hereof, greater cruelty
and mischyefe was done and executed. For in open streat, lyke beastes in
the Shambles, they were cut and hewed in peeces, which seemed to murmur
at thys bloudy and vnlawfull act: the rest were banished and expelled
the cytty. Eight hundred of these exiled persons fled into Etolia
(a&nbsp;prouince adioyninge to Epirus, which now is called
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page212" id = "page212">212</a></span>
Albania.) Those people so banished out of theyr country, made instant
sute to Aristotimus to suffer Wyues and chyldren to repayre to them: but
theyr suite was in vayne, their peticions and supplycations seemed to be
made to the deafe, and dispersed into the wyndes: notwithstandinge,
within few dayes after, he caused by sound of trumpet to be openly
proclaymed, that it should be lawful for the wyues and chyldren of the
banished to passe wyth their baggage and furniture to theyr husbands in
Ætolia. This Proclamation was exceeding ioyfull to al the women whose
husbands were exiled, which at the least by common report were the
numbre of 6 hundreds: and for more credite of that Proclamation, the
wicked Tyrant did ordayne, that al the company should depart vpon a
prefixed day. In the meane time, the ioyful Wyues glad to visit their
poore husbands, prepared horse and wagon, to cary theyr prouisions. The
appoynted day of their departure out of that City being come, all of
them assembled at a certayne gate assygned for their repayre, who that
time together resorted with their little children in their hands bearing
vpon theyr heads theyr garments and furnitures, some on horseback, and
some bestowed in the wagons according as ech of theyr states required:
when al things wer in a readinesse to depart, and the gate of the City
opened, they began to issue forth. They wer no soner gone out of the
City walles, and had left behind them the soile of theyr natiuity, but
the Tyrants guard and Sergeants brake vpon them, and before they were
approched they cried out to stay and go no further vpon pain of theyr
liues. So the pore amazed women, contrarry to the promise of the Tyrant,
wer forced to retire. Which sodain countremaund was sorowful and woful
vnto the afflicted flock: but there was no remedy, for procede they
could not. Then those Termagants and villains caught theyr horse by the
bridles, and droue back again theyr wagons, pricking the pore oxen and
beasts with theyr speares and Iauelins, that horrible it is to report
the tyrany vsed towards man and best, in such wyse as the pore miserable
women (God wot) contrary to their desyres, were forced in dispyte of
theyr teeth to retourn. Som alack fell of theyr horse wyth theyr little
babes in theyr lappes, and were miserably troden vnder the horsefeete,
and ouerrun with the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page213" id = "page213">213</a></span>
wheles of the wagons theyr brains and guts gushing out through the
weight and comberance of the cariage, and (which was most pitiful) one
of them not able to help an other, and much lesse to rescue theyr yong
and tendre sucking babes, the vyle sergeants forcing ech wight with
theyr staues and weapons maugre theyr desirous mindes to reenter the
City. Many died by the constrained meanes out of hand, many were troden
vnder the horsefeete, and many gasping betwene life and death: but the
greatest soart of the litle infants were slaine out of hand, and crusht
in pyeces: those whych remayned alyue, were commytted to Pryson, and the
goods which they caryed wyth them altogyther seased vpon by the tyrant.
Thys wycked and cruell facte was most intollerable and greeuous vnto the
Cytyzens of Elis, wherevppon the holy dames consecrated to the God
Bacchus, adorned and garnyshed wyth theyr pryestly Garments, and bearyng
in theyr Handes the sacred mysteryes of theyr God, as Aristotimus was
passyng through the Streete garded with hys Souldyers and Men of Warre,
wente in processyon to fynde hym oute. The Sergeauntes for the reuerence
of those religious women disclosed, and gaue them place to enter in
before the Tyrant. He seing those Women apparelled in that guise, and
bearing in their hands the sacred Bachanal mysteries, stoode stil, and
with silence heard what they could say: but when he knew the cause of
their approch, and that they wer come to make sute for the poore
imprisoned women, sodainly possessed with a diuelish rage, with horrible
hurly burly, bitterly reprehended his garrison for suffering those women
to come so neare him. Then hee commaunded that they should be expelled
from that place without respect, and condemned euery of them (for their
presuming to intreat for such caitiue prisoners<ins class = "addition"
title = "close parenthesis missing">)</ins> in <span class =
"smallroman">II.</span> Talents a piece. After these mischiefs committed
by the tyrant, Hellanicus one of the pryncipal and best esteemed persons
of the City, although that he was decrepite, and for age very weake and
feeble, cared not yet to aduenture any attempt what soeuer, so it might
extend to the deliuery of his countrey from the vnspeakable tyranny of
most cruel Aristotimus. To this gray haired person, bicause he was of
aged yeares, void of children which were dead, this Tyrant gaue no great
hede ne yet emploied any care, thinking that he
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page214" id = "page214">214</a></span>
was not able to raise any mutine or tumult in the City. In the mean
space, the Citizens, which as I haue sayd before, were banished into
Etolia, practysed amongs them selves to proue their Fortune, and to
seeke al meanes for recouery of their countrey, and the death of
Aristotimus: wherfore hauing leuied and assembled certaine bands of
Souldiers, they marched forth from their bannished seat, and neuer
rested till they had gotten a place hard adioyning to their City, where
they might safely lodge, and with great commodity and aduantage besige
the same, and expel the tyrant Aristotimus. As the bannished were
incamped in that place, many citizens of Elis daily fled forth, and
ioyned with them, by reason of which auxiliaries and daily assemblies
they grew to the ful numbre of an army: Aristotimus certified hereof by
his espials was brought into a great chafe and fury, and euen now began
to presage his fall and ruine: but yet meaning to foresee hys best
aduantage, went vnto the pryson where the Wyues of the banished were
fast inclosed, and bicause he was of a troublesome and tyrannical
nature, he concluded with him self rather to vse and intreat those wiues
with feare and threates, than with humanity and fayre wordes: being
entred the pryson, hee sharpely and wyth great fiercenesse commaunded
them to write vnto their husbands that besieged him without, earnestly
to persuade them to giue ouer theyr attempted warres: “Otherwyse
(sayd&nbsp;he) if ye do not follow the effect of my commaundement, in
your own presence I wil first cause cruelly to be slayne al your little
Children, tearyng them by piece meale in pieces, and afterwardes I wyll
cause you to be whipped and scourged, and so to dye a most cruel and
shamefull death.” At which fierce and tyrannycal newes, there was no one
woman amongs them that opened theyr mouthes to answer him: the most
wycked and vile tyrant seing them to be in such silence, charged them
vpon theyr liues to answer what they were disposed to doe: but although
they durst not speake a word, yet with silence one beholding eche other
in the face, fared as though they cared not for hys threats, more ready
rather to dye than to obey his comaundement. Megistona then, which was
the wife of Timolion, a&nbsp;matrone aswell for hir husband’s nobility
as hir owne vertue, in great regard and estimation, and the chief amongs
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page215" id = "page215">215</a></span>
all the Women, who at his comming in would not rise, but kept her place,
nor vouchsafing to doe any reuerence or honor vnto hym, and the like she
bad the rest: in this wyse sitting vpon the ground with vnlosed tongue
and liberty of speach, stoutly she answered the tyrant’s demaund in this
manner: “If there were in thee, Aristotimus, any manly prudence,
wisedome, or good discretion, truly thou wouldest not commaund vs poore
imprisoned women to write vnto our husbands, but rather suffer vs to goe
vnto them, and vse more moderate wordes and myld behauiour, than
wherewith of late thou diddest entertaine vs, by scoffing, mocking, and
cruelly dealyng with vs, and oure pore children: and if now thou being
voyd of all hope, doest seeke to persuade by our meanes likewise to
deceiue our husbands, that be come hither to put theyr Lyues in Peryll
for our deliveraunce, I&nbsp;assure the thou vainly begilest thy selfe,
for wee henceforth do purpose neuer to bee deceyued of the: wee require
thee also to thinke and stedfastly beleeue, that our husbands heades bee
not so mutch bewitched with Folly, as despysing their Wyves and
Chyldren, Neglecting their duetyes towards them, wyll, being in this
forwardnesse, abandon their preseruation and geeve ouer the Liberty of
theyr countrey: think also that they little esteme or wey the regard of
vs, and theyr children, in respect of the great contentation they shal
attaine by vnyoking the liberty of theyr countrey from thy pride and
intollerable bondage, and which is worst of al, from that tyranny which
neuer people felt the like: for if thou were a king as thou art a
tyrant, if thou were a Gentleman borne of noble kind as thou arte a
slaue, proceding from the deuil, thou wouldest neuer execute thy cursed
cruelty against a feble kind, such as women be, and werest thou alone
ioyned in singular combat with my valyant and dere beloued husband, thou
durst not hand to hand to shew thy face: for commonly it is seene, that
the Courtly Ruffyan backed on wyth such mates as he is himself, careth
not what attempt he taketh in hand, and stares with hayre vpright,
loking as though he would kil the deuyll, but when he is preast to
seruyce of the field, and in order to encountre with his Prynce’s foe,
vpon the small sway by shocke or push that chaunceth in the fight, he is
the first that taketh flyght, and laste that
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page216" id = "page216">216</a></span>
standeth to the face of hys ennimy. Such kind of man art thou, for so
long as our husbands wer farre of, absent fro theyr Country, not able to
rid vs from thy thral, thou wroughtest thy malyce then against theyr
wyues at home, doyng the greatest cruelty towardes them and theyr
suckyng babes, that euer deuyl could do vpon the damned sort, and now
thou seest them arriued here vnder our country walles, thou flyest and
seekest help at women’s hands, whose power if it serued them according
to their willes, would make thee tast the fruit of thy commytted smart.”
And as she would haue proceded further in hir liberal talk, the Caytife
tyrant not able to abyde any further speach, troubled beyond measure,
presently commaunded the litle child of hir to be brought before him, as
though immediatly he would haue killed him, and as his seruants sought
him out, the mother espied him playing amongs other children, not
knowinge for his small stature and lesse yeres, wher he was becom, and
calling him by his name, said vnto him: “My boy, come hither, that first
of al thou mayst lose thy life, to feele the proufe and haue experience
of the cruel tyranny wherin we be, for more grieuous it is to me to see
the serue against the nobility of thy bloud, than dismembred and torn in
pieces before my face.” As Megistona stoutly and vnfearfully had spoken
those words, the furious and angry tyrant drew forth his glistring blade
out of the sheath, purposing to have slaine the gentlewoman, had not one
Cilon the familiar freend of <ins class = "correction" title =
"error for ‘Aristotimus’">Aristimus</ins> stayd his hand, forbidding him to
commit an act so cruel. This Cilon was a fayned and counterfayt frend of
the tyrant, very conuersant with other his familiar frends, but hated
him with deadly hatred, and was one of them that with Hellanicus had
conspired against the tyrant. This gentleman then seeinge Aristotimus
wyth so great fury to waxe wood agaynst Megistona, imbraced him, and
sayd, that it was not the part of a gentleman proceeding from a Race
righte honourable, by any meanes to imbrue hys Handes in Woman’s bloud,
but rather the signe and token of a cowardly knyght, wherfore he
besought him to stay his hands. Aristotimus persuaded by Cilon, appeased
his rage, and departed from the imprisoned women. Not long after,
a&nbsp;great prodige and wonder appeared in this sort: before supper the
tyrant and his wyfe withdrue
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page217" id = "page217">217</a></span>
themselues into their chamber, and being there, an Egle was seene to
soare ouer the tyrante’s palace, and being aloft, by little and little
to descend, and letting fal from her tallands a huge and great stone
vpon the top of that chamber, with clapping wings and flying noyse
soared vp againe, so far as she was cleane out of sight from them that
did behold hir. With the rumor and shouts of those that saw this sight,
Aristotimus was appalled, and vnderstanding the circumstance of the
chaunce, hee sent for his diuine to declare the signification of this
Augurye, which greatly troubled his minde. The Southsayer bad him to be
of good chere, for that it did portend the great fauour and loue which
Iupiter bare vnto him. But the prophet of the City whom the Cytizens had
wel tryed and proued to be faithfull and trusty, manifested vnto them
the great daunger that hong ouer the tyrant’s head, sutch as the lyke
neuer before. The confederats which had conspired wyth Hellanicus, made
great speede to prosecute theyr enterprise, and the next night to kil
the tyrant. The very same night Hellanicus dreamed that he saw his dead
sonne to speak vnto him these woords: “What meane you father this long
tyme to sleepe, I&nbsp;am one of your sonnes whom Aristotimus hath
slayne, know you not that the same day you attempt your enterpryse, you
shalbe captaine and prince of your country?” By this vision Hellanicus
confirmed, he rose bytimes in the morninge, and exhorted the
conspirators that day to execute the benefit of their country. That time
Aristotimus was certified how Craterus the Tyrant of another Citty, with
a great army, was comming to his ayde agaynst the Banished people of
Elis, and that hee was arriued at Olympia, a&nbsp;Citty betweene the
mount Ossa, and the mountayne Olympus. With whych newes Aristotimus
beinge incouraged, thought already that he had put to flight and taken
the banished persons, which made him to aduenture hymselfe abroade
wythout Guard or garrison, accompanied only wyth Cilon and one or two of
his familiar frendes, the very same time that the conspiratours were
assembled to do the facte. Hellanicus seeing the time so conuenient to
deliuer his beloued countrey by the death of the traiterous tirant, not
attending any signe to be geuen to his companions (although the same was
concluded vpon) the lusty old man liftinge
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page218" id = "page218">218</a></span>
vp his handes and eyes vnto the heauens, with cleare and open voyce
cried out to his companions and sayd: “Why stay yee, O&nbsp;my Cityzens
and louinge countrymen, in the face of your Citty to finish this good
and commendable act?” At whych words, Cilon was the first which with his
brandishing blade killed one of those that wayted vpon the Tirant.
Thrasibulus then and Lampidus assayled Aristotimus, vpon whose sodayne
approche, he fled into the Temple of Iupiter, where hee was murdred with
a thousand wounds vpon his body, accordingly as he deserued. He beinge
thus deseruedly slayne, his body was drawen vp and down the streetes,
and proclamation of liberty sounded vnto the people: whereunto ech Wyght
assembled, amonges whom the imprisoned Women also brake forth, and
reioysed with their countrey deliuerers of that egregious enterprise, by
fires and bankets outwardly disclosinge their exceedinge great ioy
wythin, and in mid of their mirth the people in great thronges and
companies ranne to the Tyrant’s Palace, whose Wyfe hearinge the people’s
noyse, and certified of her husband’s death, inclosed her selfe in a
chamber with her two daughters, and knowinge how hatefull she was vnto
the Citizens, with a fastned cord vpon a beame she hong hir selfe. The
chamber dores being broke open, the people viewed the horrible sight of
the strangled Lady, wherewithall not mooued they tooke the two
tremblinge Daughters of the Tyrant, and caryed them away, purposinge to
Rauish and Violate the same, firste to saciate their lust with the
spoyle of theire virginitye, and afterwardes to kyll them (those
gentlewomen were very beautiful and mariageable) and as they were about
to do that shamefull deede, Megistona was told thereof, who accompanied
with other Matrons sharpelye rebuked theire furye sayinge: that vncomely
it were for them which sought to establishe a ciuill state, to do such a
shameles act as tyrant’s rage would scarce permit. Vpon that noble
matron’s auctoritye and interception, they ceassed from their filthy
fact: and then the woman tooke the virgins out of the people’s handes,
and brought them into the chamber where there strangled mother was. And
vnder standing howe it was decreede that none of the tyrante’s bloude
should rest a liue: shee turned her face to the two yonge gentlewomen
and sayde: “The chiefest
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page219" id = "page219">219</a></span>
pleasure which I can do vnto you, resteth in this choyse, that it shall
be lauful for eyther of you to chose what kind of death you list, by
knyfe or halter, if you wil to dispatch your liues from the headles
peoples greatter fury, vppon whose two whyte and tender bodyes if they
do seaze the goddes do knowe and we do feare the cruelty and great abuse
which they do mean to vse, I&nbsp;thinke not for despyte of you, but for
the iust reuenge of your most cruell father’s actes, for the tyrannous
life of whom the goddes do thunder downe the boltes of their
displeasure, afflicting his nearest blood and bestbeloued wyfe and
children, with vengeance poured from heauens.” Vppon the sentence of
this the fatall ende, the elder mayden of the twayne vnlosed a gyrdle
from her middle, and began to tye the same to hang hir selfe, exhorting
her yonger sister to do the lyke: and in any wise to beware by sparing
of her life, to incur the beastly rage of the monstruous people, which
cared not to do ech vile and filthy act, vnworthy theyr estate. The
yonger sister at those wordes, layd handes vpon the fastened corde, and
besought hir right earnestly first of al to suffer hir to die. Wherevnto
the elder aunswered: “So long as it was lawfull for me to liue, and
whiles we led our princely time in our father’s courte, and both were
free from enimie’s danger, all things betwene vs two were common and
indifferent, wherefore the gods forbid (that now the gates of death be
opened for vs to enter, when with the Ghostes of our deere Parentes our
soules amids the infernall fieldes be predestined to raunge and wander)
that I shoulde make denyall of thy request. Therfore goe to good sister
mine, and shrink not when thou seest the vgly face of her, that must
consume vs all: but yet (dere sister) the deadly sight of thee before my
selfe, will breede to me the woe and smart of double death.” When she
had so sayd, she yelded the coller to her sister, and counselled hir to
place the same so neere the necke bone as shee could, that the sooner
the halter’s force might stop her breath. When the vnfearefull yonger
sister was dead, the trembling hands of the dredlesse elder maid vntied
the girdle from her neck, couering in comely wise her senselesse corps.
Then turning hir self to Megistona, she humbly prayd hir not to suffer
their two bodies to be seene naked, but so sone as she could, to bury
them both in one
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page220" id = "page220">220</a></span>
Earthly graue, referring the frutes of their virginity to the mould
wherof they came. When she had spoken these wordes, without any stay or
feare at all, with the selfe same corde she strangled herselfe and so
finished her fatal dayes. The guiltlesse death of which two tender
maydes there was none of the citizens of Elis (as&nbsp;I suppose) so
stonye hearted and voyde of Nature’s force, ne yette so wrothe agaynst
the tyrant father, but did lament, as wel for the constant stoutenes and
manner of their death, as for their maydenlyke behauiour and right
honest petitions made to that noble matrone Megisthona, who afterwardes
caused the other dames to bury those two bodyes in one graue. O&nbsp;how
happy and famous had these two sisters bene, if they had not bene the
daughters of so wicked and cruell a father? But parentes offence or
childrens trespas ought not to deface the vertuous dedes of their
posterity.</p>

that her husband beyng stout and valiant should attayne some place of
resiaunce. For she shall be called to remembrance that Tatius the
Sabine, Numa borne of the stocke of Curetes and Ancus, broughte forthe
by a Sabine woman
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page222" id = "page222">222</a></span>
all straungers, did rayne and became noble and mightye. Thus ambicion
and desire of honoure easily doth perswade any deuyse: wherfore carying
with them all their substance they repaired to Rome. It chaunced when
they came to Ianiculum, as he and his wife were sitting in a Wagon, an
Eagle hooueringe hir wings ouer Lucumo, sodenly toke away his Cappe,
which don she soared ouer the Wagon with great force, then she retourned
againe, as though he had bene commaunded by some Celestyall prouidence,
and aptly placed his cappe againe vpon his head, and then soared away vp
into the element. Tanaquil conceiuing this act to be some Augurie or
Prophecie, being cunning in that knowledg (as&nbsp;commonly all the
people of Hetruria&nbsp;be) imbraced hir husband and willed him to be of
good cheere and to expect great honour. And as they were ymagining and
consulting vpon these euentes, they entred the City, and when they had
gotten a house for him and his family, he was called Tarquinius Priscus.
His riches and great welth made him a noble man amonges the Romanes, and
through his gentle entertainment and curteous behauioure, he wanne the
good willes of many, in so much as his fame and good reporte was bruted
through out the pallace. At length he grew in acquaintance with the king
him selfe, who seeing his liberall demeanor and duetifull seruice,
esteemed him as one of his familiar and nere frends, and both in his
warres and also at home he imparted to him the secrets of his counsell,
and hauing good experience of his wisedom, by his laste will and
testament appointed him to be tutor of his children. Ancus raigned <span
class = "smallroman">XXIIII.</span> yeres, a&nbsp;man in peace and
Warre, in pollicy and valiance with any of his predecessours comparable:
his children were very yong, and for that cause Tarquinius was more
instant to summon a parliament for creation of a kyng. When the day was
come he sente the young children abroade a huntyng, and then ambiciously
presumed to demaunde the kyngdome, beinge the first that euer attempted
the like. For the better conciliation and obteynyng of the peoples good
will, hee vttered his oration: “I&nbsp;do not presume to require a
straunge or newe thynge: that was neuer before put in practyse, nor yet
am the first, but the third stranger and foraine borne that affected and
aspired this gouernment: for which consideration
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page223" id = "page223">223</a></span>
there is no cause why any man ought to muse or maruell more than
behoueth. It is euidently knowen that Tatius, not onely being a stranger
but also an ennemy, was made king. Numa also was made king, being
altogether a Forraine and Stranger borne, not through his owne request,
but rather voluntarily accited and called thereunto by the Romaynes: but
for my parte, after I was able to gouerne my selfe, I&nbsp;repayred to
dwell at Rome with my Wyfe, my Children, and all my substance, where I
haue spent the chiefest portion of my lyfe, specially after it was
mature and able to execute ciuile magistery, which I chose rather to
bestowe at Rome than at home in myne owne country. I&nbsp;haue learned
the Romane rites and lawes, aswell sutch as be meete to serue abroade in
the warres, as also necessary to be practised at hoame, at the handes of
mine olde maister Ancus Martius your late king, a&nbsp;mayster right
worthy and famous in all poynctes to bee followed: I&nbsp;shewed myselfe
an humble and obedient subiect to the kyng and in frendship and
familiarity toward others, I&nbsp;contended with the kyng himselfe.”
When he had spoken those woordes, which in deede were very true, wyth
the whole consent of the people he was saluted kynge: and as all thynges
succeeded his Noble request, euen so after hee was settled in hys
kyngdome, hee gaue himselfe to amplifie the common wealth: he chose an
hundred graue persons, whych he called the Fathers of the lesser
Countryes. He warred first with the Latines, and wan the Citty of
Appiolas, who bryngyng from thence a greater spoyle and booty than was
looked for, ordayned richer and more gorgeous Playes than any of hys
predecessours: hee buylded certayne Galleries and other places of
assembly aboute the Forum, hee walled the City round about wyth Stone:
and as he was doing these things, the Sabines interuented him vpon the
sodayne, in so much as they were passed the Ryuer of Anienes before the
Romane hoste was in a readynesse: whych was an occasion of great feare
and styrre at Rome. In the ende after the battayles were ioyned betweene
them both, a&nbsp;cruell and blouddy slaughter was commytted, the
victorye falling to neyther parte. Then the Romanes sought meanes to
renue theyr force, by addyng to theyr armye a further bande of horsemen.
Wherefore Tarquinius sent to the Rammenses, Titienses,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page224" id = "page224">224</a></span>
Luceres: to the bandes that Romulus had conscribed, hee added other new
troupes of horsemen, purposing that the same should contynue in memorye
of him after hys death: and bicause Romulus dyd the same without aduyse
of the Southsayers, one Accius Nauius, the notablest Prophecier in those
Dayes, wythstode that constitutyon, affyrmyng that it was not lawfull
for him eyther to appoynt a newe order or to alter the olde, except the
byrdes and auguries did assent thereunto: wherewith the kynge was
displeased and deluding that Scyence, said: “Go to M.&nbsp;Southsayer:
tell me now” (quod&nbsp;he) “is it possible to bring that to passe which
I haue now conceiued in my mynd?” “Yea,” quod the Southsayer, “if you
tel me what it is.” “Then” quod Tarquinius, “I&nbsp;haue deuised that
thou shalte pare thine owne skin with a raser: therfore take thys knyfe
and doe as thy byrdes doe portend and signifie.” And as it was reported
he pared his owne Skin in deede: in memory whereof an Image of Accius
was erected, with his Head couered: after that tyme there was nothing
attempted without those auguries. Notwithstandyng, Tarquinius proceeded
in hys constytutyon, and added to the Centurias an other number, for
that 1800 horsemen wer conteyned in the three Centuriæ: the latter
addytion was called also by the same name, whych afterward were doubled
into <span class = "smallroman">VI.</span> Centurias. When hys Numbre
was thus increased, once again he ioyned battell wyth the Sabines, who
by a notable pollicy recouered a great victory: and bicause the Sabines
doubled a fresh onset without any order of battell or good aduysement,
they were ouerthrowen, and then constrained to make petition for peace:
the City of Collatia, and the Country confining vpon the same, was taken
from the Sabines. The Sabine warres beinge in this sorte ended,
Tarquinius in tryumphaunt maner retourned to Rome. At that time a
prodyge and myraculous wonder chaunced to bee seene in the Palace. The
head of a Chyld whose name was Seruius Tullius lying a slepe in the
palace, was seene to burn. The kyng was brought to see that myracle: and
as one of his seruaunts was going to fetch water to quench the fire, he
was stayed by the Queene, who commaunded that the child should not once
be touched vntyll he awaked of hymselfe: and so soone as hee rose
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page225" id = "page225">225</a></span>
from sleepe, the fire vanyshed: then she tooke hir husbande aside, and
sayd: “Doe you see this Chyld whom we haue very basely and negligently
brought vp? I&nbsp;assure you sir (sayd she) he wil be the onely
safeguard and defender of this our doubtfull state, and will be the
preseruer of our household when it is afflycted: wherefore let vs make
much of him, that is lyke to be the ornament and a worthy stay to all
our famyly.” After that they had accompted him amongs the Number of
theyr Chyldren, and traded him vp in those Arts, which excyte all good
dispositions to aspyre vnto <ins class = "correction" title =
"error for ‘honour’">houour</ins>, the pleasure of the Gods appeared in
shorte tyme: for the child grew to a royall behauior, in so much, as among
all the Romane youth there was none more mete to mary the daughter of
Tarquinius. This Seruius Tullius, was the sonne of one Seruius Tullius
that was a Captaine of a towne called Corniculum, at the apprehension
whereof, it chaunced that the sayd Tullius the father was slayne,
leauing his wife great with child: the mother being a captiue and
bondwoman was delyuered of hir Child at Rome, in the house of Priscus
Tarquinius. After Tarquinius had raigned 38 yeres, the yong man began to
grow to great honor and estimation, aswell with the kinge himselfe, as
also with the Fathers. Then the Romanes conceiued a hateful indignation
against the king, for that he being put in trust to be the tutor and
gouernour of Ancus children, displaced them from theyr ryght
inheritance, and specially for that he himself was a stranger, fearyng
also that the kingdome should not return again to the election of
themselues, but degenerat and grow into seruile bondage. They also caled
to remembrance, that the city continued one hundred yeres after the
sublation of Romulus, an intier kingdome within one city, and that it
was a shame for them to suffer a bondeman, borne of seruile kind, to
possesse the same, and would redounde to their perpetuall ignominie,
hauing the progenie of Ancus aliue, to suffer the same to be open to
strangers, and bondmen: wherefore they determined to defend the griefe
of that iniury, and to be reuenged rather vpon Tarquinius, than upon
Seruius. In fine, they committed the execution of that fact to two
shepherds chosen out for that purpose: who deuised this pollicy: before
the entry into the Palace they fell togyther by the eares, vpon whych
fray al the kinge’s
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page226" id = "page226">226</a></span>
officers assembled and repaired thither to know the cause of theyr
falling out, when they were parted, they appealed to the king, with such
exclamation as they were heard to the Palace: beyng called before the
king, both of them fell to brauling, and one of them striued of purpose
to hinder the tale of the other. The king’s sergeant rebuked them,
commaunding them to tel theyr tales in order: when they were a lyttle
quieted, one of them beginneth to discourse the tale. And as the king
was attentife to heare the plaintif, the other tooke vp a hatchet and
threw it at the kyng, and leauing thee weapon stickinge in the wound,
they conueyed theymselues out of the dores. Those that wayted vpon the
kynge, made hast to releeue him, and the Sergeantes followed to
apprehend the malefactors. Wyth that a hurly burly rose amongs the
people, euery man maruellinge what the matter shoulde be. Tanaquil
commaunded the Palace Gates to be shut, and seeketh remedy to cure her
husband, as though some hope fayled of his recouery, she called Seruius
before her (whych maried her daughter) and shewed vnto him her dead
husband, holdinge him fast by the right hande, shee intreated hym that
he would not suffer the death of his father in the law to be vnreuenged,
to the intent he might not be ridiculous to the traytours, saying to him
further these wordes: “If thou bee a man of thy handes (O&nbsp;Seruius)
the kyngdome is thyne and not theirs, which thus cruelly by the handes
of other haue committed thys abhominable fact: wherefore put forth thy
self, and the Gods be thy guide: for they did portend this noble head to
be the gouernour of this city, at such tyme as they circumfused the same
with a fire descending from aboue. Let that heauenly flame excite thy
courage: be throughly awaked: we beyng straungers sometimes haue
raigned. Thinke and consider what thou art, and not from whence thou
camest: if the strangenesse of the case do affray the, my counsel from
time to time shall relieue thee.” The cry and stirre of the people being
vnmesurable, that one could scarse heare an other, Tanaquil opened the
windowes that had their prospect to the new way (for the king dwelt at
the temple of Iupitor Stator) and then spake to them in thys wyse: “Be
of good cheere (good people) the king is but amazed with the sodainesse
of the stroke, the wound is not very deepe, for euen
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page227" id = "page227">227</a></span>
nowe he is come agayne to hym selfe, and the wounde being opened and
dressed there is good hope of life: I&nbsp;trust within these fewe dayes
you shall see hym: in the meane time, I&nbsp;pray you to shewe your
obedyence to Seruius Tullius, who is appointed to execute the lawes, and
to doe all other affayres in the absence of my husbande.” Seruius
occupyinge the state and authoritye of the kyng, executed the lawes in
some cases, and in other some made the people beleue that he would
consult with the king him selfe. The death of the king was concealed and
kept close a certaine space til such tyme as Seruius had gathered his
force about him. After the death of the kynge was disclosed, Seruius
beinge garded with a strong garrison, toke vpon him to be king, not by
the consente of the people, but by the will of the Fathers. The children
of Ancus vnderstanding that the kyng was aliue, and that Seruius power
and force was greate, conveyed themselues in exile to Suessa Pometia:
and leaste the children of Tarquinius should attempte lyke enterpryse
against him, as the children of Ancus did agaynst Tarquinius, hee maryed
<span class = "smallroman">II.</span> of his daughters to Lucius and
Aruns the chyldren of Tarquinius. But yet the deuise of man could not
breake the necessity of fate and constellatyon, for the hatred conceiued
in desire of ambicious gouernment, made all thyngs vnstable and
vnfaythfull amongs domestical frends: but yet to quyet and pacyfye the
present tyme, warre was renued with the Veientes, and other Cytyes of
Hetruria: wherein the Fortune and valiance of Tullius excelled: for when
he had given an ouerthrow to the ennimy, least the people’s and fathers
good wil should be withdrawne, he retourned to Rome: who then attempted
and broughte to passe a notable worke in the common wealth. He
instituted a certaine yerely taxe and reuenew, to satisfie and discharge
all charges susteined in the time of peace and warre, with sundry other
notable lawes and deuises for the defence of the publique state. After
that he had mustered the whole numbre of the Citizens in the field
called Martius, the same amounted to <span class =
"smallroman">LXXX.M.</span> and as Fabius Pictor saith, there were so
many that were able to beare armure. Then the hilles Quirinalis,
Viminalis and Exquiliæ, were added to the Citye. He compassed the town
round about wyth a vamure, enuironyng the same with a double trench. He
deuyded
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page228" id = "page228">228</a></span>
the Romanes into <span class = "smallroman">V.</span> bandes called
Classes, and into Centurias, whych bee bandes of an hundred men. He also
builded a temple to Diana, with the helpe and assistance of the Latine
people. Amongs the Sabines there chaunced an Oxe in the House of an
Husbande Man to bee broughte forth, of an huge bignesse and maruellous
shape (the hornes whereof were placed at the porche of Diana’s temple
for a monument long time after.) The Southsayers prophecie that where
the same Oxe shoulde be first sacrificed to Diana, there the Chyefe
empire and principall gouernement should remaine: which prophecie came
to the knowledge of the Chyefe minister of Diana hir Temple. One of the
Sabin’s expecting for a day mete to be employed in that sacrifice,
brought the sayde Oxe to Rome to the Temple of Diana, placing the same
before the altar. The chiefe Minister calling to remembrance the oracle,
and saw that the greatnesse of that sacrifice should be famous, spake to
the Sabine these wordes: “What dost thou meane (thou impure Straunger)
to prepare sacrifice to Diana, before thou bee purified and clensed in
the lyuelye Riuer of Tiber? Here belowe in this valley the sayde riuer
doth runne: go get the hence and wash the.” The Sabine attached with a
religious feare, goeth downe to the Riuer, and while he is washing
himselfe a Romane doth offer the Sacrifice, which was right acceptable
both to the kyng and his country. The king althoughe that of longe tyme
he had raigned, yet vnderstoode that the elder Tarquinius which was
maried to one of his daughters, did bragg and report eftsones that his
father in law obteined the gouernment and kingdom without the consent of
the people: wherfore the king through his lyberalyty by dyuyding the
conquest atchyeued of the Ennymye amongs the common people, conciliated
theyr fauor and good wils: in so much as he affirmed that he would raign
in despite of them all, and that there was no king at any tyme that
raigned with a more generall consent: all whych did nothing diminish the
hope and desire of Tarquinius. He had a Brother whose name was Aruns,
being of a quiet and gentle disposition. Both they married two of the
king’s daughters, which were of manners and conditions very vnlike. The
yonger daughter being the wife of Aruns, the sharper shrewe, and fiercer
of nature, seeing that hir husbande
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page229" id = "page229">229</a></span>
was nothing giuen or plyant to match with hir vngracious deuice or
ambicious stomack, attempted hir brother, whose condicion was
correspondent to hirs, and sayd vnto him, that he was a Man in deede,
and one worthy to be accompted to be borne and proceede of the bloud
Royall. Then she began to contemne hir sister, for that she hauing such
a man to hir husbande, would suffer him to neglect so meete and iust
occasion for recouery of the kingdom. Their natures being of one
disposition, as commonly one myschyefe procureth an other, al things
began to be disquieted throughe the attempt of that vngracious woman. To
be shorte, they two deuysed meanes, that Aruns hys Brother, and the
Elder Tullia hir sister were slain: which done, they two maried
together. The wicked woman ceased not daylye to animate and prouoke hir
husbande from one parricide to an other. And amongs all hir wicked talke
and cruel instigations, she vsed these words: “If thou be that man vnto
whom I thinke I am maryed, then I wil call the both husband and king:
but if thou bee not hee, then the alteratyon is chaunged to the worse,
and cruelty is matched with cowardise. But why doest thou not put thy
selfe in a readinesse? Why thou commest not nowe from Corinthe, or from
the Hetrurian Tarquines, to atchieue and conquere newe kingdoms as thy
father did<ins class = "correction" title = ". for ?">. </ins>The
familiar Gods and the Gods of thy countrey, the nobility of thy father,
and thy royal bloud, thy stately seate within thine own house, and thy
name Tarquinius, do create and make kyng. But if in al these occasions
thou dost wante stomacke, why dost thou make the whole Citye conceyue a
false opinion of thee? Why dost thou not shewe thyselfe to be the sonne
of a king? Auoide hence I say, and go to the Tarquinians, or to Corinth,
retire again to thy firste lynage: thou dost rather resemble thy
brother’s effeminate hart, than the valiant stomacke of thy father.”
With these wordes and sutch like, she pricked forward hir husbande, and
she hir self could in no wise bee quiet. Then Tarquinius went forth to
the fathers of the lesser countries, and called to theyr remembraunce
the benefites vnto them by hys father extended, desiring the like to bee
shewed and rendered vnto hym, he allured the yonger sort of the City by
giftes and other lyberall rewardes, promising them if he atteined his
purpose, more frankly to recompence
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page230" id = "page230">230</a></span>
them. By this meanes the king became odious and offensiue to the people.
Tarquinius seeing his time, guarded with a bande of Men, entred the
market place, wherewith the common people were greatly abashed, then he
mounted into the palace, and placed himselfe in the royal seate of the
same, causinge the Fathers to be cited before hym by the haraulde, vnto
whom he repeted the petigree of Seruius, and his first entrance into the
kingdom. As he was speaking these wordes, Seruius in great haste
repayred to the Palace, and findyng Tarquinius sitting in his place,
sayd to him these wordes: “Why? what is the matter Tarquinius
(quod&nbsp;he?) Howe darest thou be so bolde so long as I am liuing to
call the Fathers, or yet presume to sit in my seat?” Wherunto Tarquinius
fiercely replyed: “That hee possessed but the roume of his father, which
was more mete for a king’s sonne and heyre, than for suche a bondeman as
hee was, and that hee had long enough abused his lordes and maisters.”
Wherwithal a great hurly burly and tumult began to rise by the fautors
of both parts, so that he was like to attaine the Garland, which best
could daunce for it. Tarquinius forced to giue the laste aduenture,
beynge more lusty and stronger than the other, tooke Seruius by the
myddle, and caryinge hym oute of the Courte, threwe hym downe the
Staires, whyche done, hee caused the Senate to retourne into the Palace.
Then the kynge wyth all hys trayne of Offycers, and other hys seruaunts
ranne away, and as they were flying, hee was slayne by those that
Tarquinius sent after to pursue hym, in the streete called Cyprius.
Tullia vnderstandyng that Seruius hyr father was slayne, she bashed not
in hir Wagon to come into the market place before all the assemblye
there, called hir husband out of the Court, and boldly was the first
that called him king. But being rebuked and commaunded by him to auoid
out of that greate throng of people, she retired home agayn, and when
she was paste the vpper ende of the said strete called Cyprius, the
wagoner dryuing toward the right hand to the Hill called Exquiliæ, hee
stayed the Wagon, and shewed his Ladye the bodye of hyr Father, lyinge
starke dead in the streete. In memory of which shamefull and vnnatural
fact, long tyme after ther contynued a Monument: for the same strete was
called Vicus Sceleratus. Some report that
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page231" id = "page231">231</a></span>
she caused the wagon to be dryuen ouer the dead corps of hir father,
wyth the bloud of whom and hir husband, hir wagon being contaminated,
she presented the same to hir Gods: after which abhominable beginnings,
like end ensued. This Seruius Tullius raigned <span class =
"smallroman">XLIIII.</span> yeres. Then Tarquinius began to raigne, vnto
whom Superbus was added for his surname: this wicked sonne in law would
not suffer the dead body of Seruius to be buried. His conscience being
pricked with the abhominable gaine of hys kyngdom, fearying also least
other might conceiue like example, he guarded his person with a band of
armed men, executing all thinges wyth force and tyranny, contrary to the
aduyse and consents of the Senate and people. He caused the fautors and
frendes of Seruius to be put to death, whereby the numbre of the Fathers
was diminished, whose places he suffred none other to supply, of purpose
to bring that honourable order to contempt. He gouerned the common welth
by his own domestical and priuate Counsel: War, peace, truce, society of
the Cyties adioining, he vsed as he list, without any further assent.
The Latines he specially regarded, to the intent that through forreine
aide hee might raign in more surety at home, with the chief of which
country he ioyned affinity. One Octauius Manilius, a&nbsp;Tusculan born,
was the prince and chief ruler of that country, descending from the
stock of Vlisses, and the Goddesse Circes, if the same be true, vnto
whom Tarquinius gaue his daughter in mariage: by reason wherof he
conciliated great alliance and frendes. Tarquinius beinge of great
authority among the Latines, appointed them vppon a day to assemble at a
woode called Ferentina, there to intreat of matters concerninge both the
states. To which place the Latines repaired vpon the breake of the day,
but Tarquinius came not thither till the Sunne was set. During whych
time many things were in talke. There was one amonges them called Turnus
Herdonius, whych in Tarquinius absence had inueyed vehemently agaynst
hym, affirminge that it was no maruell though he was called Superbus by
the Romanes. For what prouder mock could be inforced to the Latines,
than to make them wayt a whole day for his pleasure. “Dyuers Princes and
Noblemen (quod&nbsp;he) that dwel far of, be come according to the
appointment, and he which
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page232" id = "page232">232</a></span>
first allotted the day, is not present. Heereby it most euidently
appeareth in what sort he will vse vs if he myghte once attayne the
soueraynty. And who doubteth in thys so manyfest apparance, but that he
went about to affect the Dominion of the Latines? If the Romanes haue
had iust cause to beleeue him, and if their Kyngdome had ben but gotten
and not violently rapt and stolne by parricide, then the Latines mighte
also beleeue hym, who being but a straunger to them, had no great cause
to beleeue hym. Hys owne subiects do repent the time that euer he bare
rule: For some be slayne and heaped vpon the dead bodies of other, some
be banished, some haue lost their goods: what other frutes than these
maye the Latine people expecte and look for? Therefore if they would be
ruled, he required euery man to returne home to his own house, and geue
no more attendaunce for the day of Counsel, than he doth which first
appoincted the same.” These wordes and sutch like, this sedicious and
desperat man declared: Whose talke Tarquinius interuented, and vpon his
comming euery man conuerted him selfe to salute him. Then Tarquinius
began to excuse his long tariaunce, for that he was appoynted an
arbitrator betwene the father and the sonne, for whose reconciliation he
was forced to stay that longe space, and to spend the time of that day.
Wherefore he appoynted the next day. The conceit of which excuse Turnus
could not kepe secret, but sayd: that a matter betwene the father and
the sonne might be ended in few wordes: for if the childe would not be
obedient to his father, some mischyef must needes lyght vppon him.
Tarquinius vnderstanding these inuections made againste hym by Turnus,
immediatly deuyseth meanes to kil him, to the intent he myght inculcate
like terror to the Latines, that he did to his owne subiects. And
bicause he was not able to sort his purpose to effect by secrete malice,
he attempted to accuse him of Treason, and suborned (by&nbsp;means of
diuers of the Citty of Aricia) his owne man whom with gold he had
corrupted to bring in a forged accusation, whych was that his maister
had prepared in one night a number of men with Munition and weapon to
distroy the Nobility of the Latines, of purpose to recouer the
principalitye of the same. This matter began to be suspicious, by reason
of the Tumult made the day beefore against Tarquinius, and therefore the
people the soner
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page233" id = "page233">233</a></span>
did credit the case. In fine, Turnus was condempned, and therefore a new
kind of death deuised for him. Who being laide vpon a Hurdle his face
vpward, was throwen into the water of Ferrentina. This execution being
done Tarquinius reuoked the Latines to Counsel, wherein he praised them
for their Iustice extended vpon Turnus, and then spake these wordes:
“I&nbsp;may by an old order and constitution iustlye say thus mutch vnto
you. The whole nation of the Latines descending from the City of Alba
are bounde to obserue that truce which the Albanes wyth all their
colonies annexing themselues to the Romane Empyre in the tyme of Tullius
Hostilius, were firmely obliged to accomplishe. The renouation whereof
will nowe conduce more aduauntage and vtylity to them al, than euer it
did beefore. For throughe this Truce the Latines shall possede and
participate parte of the prosperous successe of the Romane people.
Better it were in this sort to ioyne themselues togither, than to see
Destruction of either Cities, Depopulacions and spoiles of their
countries, whych in the time of Ancus (my&nbsp;father then raygnyng) he
suffered. The like also (if&nbsp;you do forsake this offer) ye may styll
expecte and suffer.” The Latines herevnto were soone perswaded,
a&nbsp;Day was appointed when the lustiest sorte of theyr Countrie
should be ready armed at the wood called Ferrentina. Being ioyned in
order of battel, they marched towardes the Volsciens, and wanne the
Citye of Suessa Pometia, the spoile wherof Tarquinius solde for <span
class = "smallroman">XL.</span> Talents, imploying the same vpon the
Temple of Iupiter. Afterwards he assaulted the Gabinians, and when he
saw he coulde not by force obteyne the same, he surmised a pollicy. Who
seeming to bend him self wholy vpon the building of the Capitole and to
set aside the affaires of his warres, deuised with his sonne Sextus,
which was the youngest of the three, that he should runne to the
Gabinians, and complayne of his father’s intollerable crueltye, whych
accordingly he did. Who shewinge hymselfe as a voluntarye exyle, sayd
that hys father had conuerted hys tyrannye from other, and began to
execute the same vpon his owne freendes, and that he was also weary of
the presence of his owne chyldren going about to remoue hys domesticall
conuersants oute of hys house, as he had done the like out of the Court,
to the intent hee would leaue no ofspring or heyre behinde
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page234" id = "page234">234</a></span>
him to possesse his kingdome: adding further, that he was escaped euen
through the midde of his father’s weapons and fury, thincking no place
better for his safegarde and refuge, than to seeke succour amongs his
ennimies. “And bicause (quod&nbsp;he) ye shall not be deceiued, he is
euen now preparing of warres against you, and purposeth vpon the sodaine
to set vpon you. Now if there be no place of abode for me your humble
suppliant amongs you, I&nbsp;must needes wander through Italy, and first
I will attempt the Volscians, afterwardes the Æquians and Hernicians,
tyll sutch tyme as I finde some Nation willing to defend the poore
Chylde from the cruell and wicked furye of the Father: and perchaunce
(quod&nbsp;he) ye shall wynne hym that may bee an Instrument and courage
vnto you all, to represse that proude kyng and cruell Natyon.” The
Gabinians delyberating what was best to be done in this case, the young
man seemed as though he were offended, and would in al hast depart, and
seeke refuge of others, then they curteously interteined him: thys yong
man was had in great estimation amongs them, throughe craftye and vaine
persuasions, makyng them belieue that he would conduct their army euen
vnder the walles of Rome, with sundry other fained instigations to
brynge him self the more in credit. At length he was chosen captain of
theyr warres, and recouered sundry victories for the Gabinians: whereby
the foolishe Nation both of the lower and chiefest sort, beleeued that
their captayne was sent vnto them by the prouidence of the Gods. He
susteined perill and payne in like sort as the common Souldier did,
liberally deuidinge his spoiles and booties amongs them. He was so well
beloued, that hys father Tarquinius at Rome was of no greater authority
than hee was among the Gabinians. When he thought that he had recouered
force enough to answer his father’s expectation, he sent a post to Rome
to know his father’s pleasure, although the gods had giuen him
sufficient authority amongs the Gabinians. And bycause Tarquinius was
doubtful of the trust and fidelity of the messenger, hee would aunswer
nothing by worde of mouth, but carying the messenger into a garden, hard
adioyning his house, with a wand which he caried in his hand, he cut of
the heads of the highest Poppies that grew in the garden, meanyng therby
that he shoulde dispatche the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page235" id = "page235">235</a></span>
heads of the chiefest and principal in the City. Whervpon the messanger
without answere by mouth returned. But by declaryng those signes and
circumstances which his father vsed in the garden Sextus conceiued his
meaning. Then like a naturall sonne, following the steppes of his
father, he cut of the heads of the Gabinian nobility, wherupon som ran
away, vpon whose departure the goods as wel of them as of other that
were put to death were deuided. The state of the Gabinians being in this
doubtful case, void of al counsell and succour, at length was surrendred
to the Romanes. Then Tarquinius concluded peace with the Æquians, and
renued a truce with the Thuscanes and wholly bent him self to the
affayres of the City. This Tarquinius was the father of him that
rauished the noble Lady Lucretia: the lamentable history whereof, is
recited in my former Tome, by the end of which stock, remembred in that
history, and begining of the same described in this Nouell, may be
gathered, what fruyctes Ambytyon and lothsome luste bryng forth. For
Tarquinius Priscus repairing out of Hetruria, to dwell at Rome, by the
ambycyous wyll of hys wyfe aspired and atchyeued the kyngdome, whych was
by the sundry deuyce of Tullia, the daughter of Seruius Tullius
mainteyned, and by the libidinous desire of Sextus Tarquinius, the sonne
of Superbus the 6 Romane kynge ended, and the whole race expelled and
euerlastingly banished out of that Citty. So meete an example for those
that breath, and longe after the Rightes, titles, and Kyngdomes of
other, as may bee read in any Author. For although the Springe appeare
very fresh and lusty, of some degenerate grifft planted vpon some
auncient stock, yet the fruyct most commonly in taste eateth somwhat
sower, and the Rellishe in mouth not altogether so pleasaunt, as that
whych both in soyle and stocke, is duely planted.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">If</span> men would haue afore
consideration of theyr owne doings, before they do attempt the same, or
els premeditate and study the scope and successe thereof, I&nbsp;do
verely beleeue that a numbre would not cast themselues headlong into so
many gulfs of miseryes and calamityes as they do, specially Noblemen,
and Prynces, who oftentymes doe exceede in temerity and rashnesse, by
lettynge the Raynes of theyr own Lustes, to farre to raunge at large,
wherein they deepely Plunge thymselues to theyr great Preiudice and
Dishonour, as teacheth thys goodly hystorie ensuinge, whych declareth
that there was a Prynce called Massinissa, the Sonne of Gala kynge of
Massæzali, (a&nbsp;people of Numidia): who warfaring with the
Carthaginians in Spaine agaynst the Romaynes, hauinge first fought
honourably agaynst kynge Syphax in Numidia, it chaunced that Gala hys
Father dyed, vppon whose death hys Kyngdome was inuaded and occupied by
other, wherefore sustayninge stoutly the surges of aduersity combatinge
wyth hys Enemyes, sometymes getting part of hys Kyngdome, and sometymes
losinge, and many tymes molestinge both Syphax and the Carthaginians,
was in dyuers Conflicts lyke to be taken or slayne. Wyth these hys
trauels, impacient of no payne and trouble, he became very Famous and
Renoumed, that amonges the people of Affrica, he acquired the name and
title of a valiant and puissant Souldier, and of a pollitique and
prouident Captain: afterwards he was generally welbeloued of the
Souldiers, bicause not like the king’s sonne or a prince, but as a
priuate souldier and companion, his conuersation and vsuall trade of
life was amongs them, calling euery man by his propre name, cherishing
and esteeming them according to their desert, obseruing neuerthelesse a
certaine comelinesse of a Superiour. This Massinissa by meanes of one
Syllanus being in Spayne, priuely entred acquaintance and familiarity
with that Scipio which afterwardes was surnamed Affricanus, and who in
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page237" id = "page237">237</a></span>
those dayes with the authoritie of Proconsul in that prouince,
victoriously subdued the Carthaginians: the same Massinissa entred
league with the Romanes and inuiolably so long as he liued obserued
amity with the Romane people, and lefte the same to his children and
posteritie as an inheritance. When the Romanes began warres in Affrica,
spedily with that power he was able to make, he repaired to his old
friend Scipio: within a whyle after Syphax beyng ouerthrowen in battell
and taken, Massinissa and Lælius were sent to surprise the chief city of
that kingdom, which sometimes were king Syphax owne, called Cirta. In
that city remayned Sophonisba, the wyfe of Syphax and daughter to
Hasdrubal of Giscon, who had alyenated hir husband from the Romanes,
being in league with them, and by hir persuasions went to aide and
defend the Carthaginians. Sophonisba perceiuing that the ennimies were
entred the City of Cirta: and that Massinissa was going towardes the
palace, determined to meete him, to proue his gentlenesse and curtesie,
whereupon in the middes of his Souldiers thronge, whych were already
entred the Palace, she stoutly thrust, and bouldlye looked round aboute,
to proue if she could espye by some signes and tokens the personage of
Massinissa. She amongs that prease perceeiued one for whose apparel,
armure and reuerence don vnto him, semed vnto hir that without doubt the
same was the king: and therefore incontinently kneeled downe before him,
and pitiously began to speake in this manner: “For so mutch
(O&nbsp;puissante prince) as felicity and good fortune, but specially
the fauour of the Gods immortall haue permitted, that thou shouldest
recouer thine auncient kingdome descended vnto the by righte and lawfull
inheritaunce, and therewithall hast taken and vanquished thine ennimy,
and now hast me at thy wyll and pleasure to saue or spyll, I&nbsp;poore
wretched myserable woman brought into bondage from Queenelyke state,
whilom leading a delycate life in Princely Courte, accompanyed with a
royall traine of beautifull dames, and nowe at thy mercifull
disposition, doe humbly appeale to thy mercye and goodnesse, whose
Princely maiesty and comfortable aspect, chereth vp my woefull heart to
loke for grace, and therefore am bold thus to presume with most humble
voice to implore and crie out, beseechyng thee to reach me
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page238" id = "page238">238</a></span>
hither thy victorious handes to kisse and salute.” This Lady was a
passing fayre gentlewoman, of flourishing age and comely behauiour, none
comparable vnto her within the whole region of Affrica: and so much the
more as hyr pleasant grace by amiable gesture of complaint did increase,
so much the heart of Massinissa was delyted, who being lusty and of
youthly age (according to the nature of the Numides,) was easily
intrapped and tangled in the nettes of Loue: whose glutting eyes were
neuer ful, nor fiery hart was satisfied in beholding and wondring at hir
most excellent beauty: not foreseeing therefore, or taking heede of the
daungerous effect of beautie’s snares, his heart being so fiercely
kindled with the swingyng flames of loue, who causing hir to rise,
exorted hir to prosecute hir supplication: then she began to procede as
foloweth: “If it may be lawfull for me thy prysoner and bondwoman
(O&nbsp;my soueraign lord) to make request, I&nbsp;humbly do beseech
thee, by thy royal maiesty, wherein no long time past my husband and I
were magnificently placed in so kynglike guise as thou art now, and by
that Numidicall name, common vnto thee and my husbande Syphax, and by
the sauinge Gods and Patrons of this City, who with better fortune and
more ioyfull successe do receyue thee into the same, that expelled
Syphax out from thence: it may please thy sacred state, to haue pity on
me. I&nbsp;require no hard and difficult thinge at thy handes, vse thine
imperiall gouernement ouer me, sutch as law of armes and reason of Warre
require: cause me if thou wilt, to pyne in cruel pryson, or do me to
sutch death with torments, as thou list to vse, the sharp, fierce and
cruel death that any wight can suffre, or Perillus Bull shall not be
dreadfull vnto me, but more deare and acceptable than wonted life in
pleasures led: for no death shal bee refused of mee, rather than to be
rendred into the proud handes of the most cruell Romanes. Rather had I
tast the trust of a natiue Numidie, borne with me in Affrike soyle, than
the faith of straungers kinde: I&nbsp;know full well that thou dost
knowe what curtesy a Carthaginian and daughter of Hasdrubal, shal surely
looke for at the Romanes hands: whose mind is fearfull of nothing more
than of theyr pride and glory intollerable: if thou (my&nbsp;lord)
haddest sisters of thine own, or daughters of thy royal bloud brought
forth
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page239" id = "page239">239</a></span>
think that they may chaunce (if&nbsp;fortune frown) to slide into the
Pit of aduerse lucke, so well as I am nowe: of that forme Fortune’s
wheele is made, whych we dayly see to be vnstable, turninge and dyuers,
that now peace and now warre it promiseth, now euill it threatneth, now
mirth, now sorrow it bringeth, now aduauncinge aloft, now tumbling downe
the clymbers up. Let Syphax bee cleare and liuely Example to thee, whych
coulde neuer finde any stedfast stay vnder the Moone’s Globe. He was the
mightiest and the richest kinge that raigned in Affrica, and now is the
most miserable and vnlucky wight that liueth on Land. The Gods graunt
that I bee no Prophet or Diuiner of future euill, whose omnipotency I
deuoutly beseech to suffer thee and thy posterity in Numidie land and
most happyly to raygne. Vouchsafe then to deliuer me from the Romanes
thraldome, which if thou bee not able safely to bryng to passe, cause
death (the ease of al woe) to be inflicted vpon me.” In speaking those
words, she tooke the kynge’s right hande and many times sweetly kissed
the same. And then her teares turned to pleasant cheare, in sutch wise
as not onely the mynde of the armed and victorious Prynce was mooued to
mercy, but straungely wrapped in the amorous Nets of the Lady, whereby
the victour was subdued by the vanquyshed, and the Lord surprysed of his
Captiue, whom with tremblinge voyce thus he aunswered: “Make an end,
O&nbsp;Sophonisba, of thy large complaynt, abandon thy conceyued feare,
for I wil not onely ridde the from the Romayne handes, but also take
thee to my lawfull wyfe (if&nbsp;thou therewyth shalt be content)
whereby thou shalte not leade a prisoner’s life, but passe thy youthfull
dayes and hoarye age (if&nbsp;gods doe graunt thy life so long) as Quene
vnto a king, and wife vnto a Romane frend.” When he had sayd so with
weeping teares, he kissed and imbraced hir. She by the countenaunce,
Sygnes, Gestes, and interrupted Woordes, comprehendyng the Minde of the
Numide king to be kindled with feruent loue: the more to inflame the
same beemoned her self with such heauinesse, as the beastly heartes of
the Hircane Tygres would haue bene made gentle and dispoiled of al
fiercenesse, yf they had beheld her: and againe she fel downe at hys
feete, kissinge the armed Sabbatons vppon the same, and bedewinge them
with hir warme teares. After many
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page240" id = "page240">240</a></span>
sobbes and infinite sighes, comforted by him, she sayd: “O&nbsp;<ins
class = "correction" title = "printed ‘the / the’ at line break">the
the</ins> glorie and honor of all the kynges that euer were, bee or
shall bee hereafter: O&nbsp;the safest aide of Carthage mine vnhappy
countrey without desert, and now the present and most terrible
astonishment: if my hard fortune and distresse after so great ruine
might haue bene relieued, what greater fauour, what thing in all my
life, coulde chaunce more fortunate, vnto me, than to bee called wife of
thee? O, I&nbsp;blessed aboue all other women to haue a man so noble and
famous to husband. O&nbsp;mine aduenturous and most happy ruine.
O&nbsp;my moste fortunate misery, that such a glorious and incomparable
mariage was prepared for me: but bicause the Gods be so contrary vnto
me, and the due ende of my life approcheth (my&nbsp;deare soueraygne
lorde) to kindle againe in me, my hope half dead, or rather consumed and
spent, bicause I see myself wrapped in a state, that in vayne against
the pleasures of the Gods, I&nbsp;go about to molest thee: a&nbsp;greate
gift (and to say truthe) a&nbsp;right great good turne, I&nbsp;make
accompte to haue receiued of thee, if mine owne death I should procure
by thee, that dyinge by thy means or with thy handes, (whych were more
acceptable,) I&nbsp;shoulde escape the feare of the Romaynes thral and
subiection, and this soule deliuered of the same, should streight passe
into the Elysian fieldes. The final scope of this my humble plaint, is
to ryd me from the hands of the Romanes, whose thraldom to suffer I had
rather die. The other benefit which thou dost frankly offer to me pore
wretch, I&nbsp;dare not desire, mutch lesse require the same, bicause
the present state of my mishap dareth not presume so high. But for this
thy pity and compassion ioined with louing regard and mind toward me,
mightye loue with al the other Gods reward and blesse thy gotten kingdom
in long raign, enlarging the same with more ample bounds to thine
eternal renoum and praise: and I do not only render humble thanks for
this thy kynd and louing enterteinment, but also yeld my self thine own,
so long as lyfe gouerneth this caitif corps of mine.” These words wer
pronounced with such effect, as Massinissa was not able for pity to hold
his teares, which watred so his comely form, as the dew therof soaked
into his tender heart, and not able a long time to speake, at last thus
hee sayd: “Gyue ouer (O&nbsp;my quene)
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page241" id = "page241">241</a></span>
these cares and thoughts, dry vp thy cries and plaints, make an end of
all these dolorous sutes, and reioyce, that frowarde Fortune hath
changed hir mind: the Gods no doubt with better successe, wil perfourm
the rest of thy liuing dais. Thou shalt henceforth remain my Quene and
wife, for pledg whereof the sacred Godheads I cal to witnesse. But if
perchaunce (which the thundring mighty God aboue forbid) that I shalbe
forced to render thee the Romanes prisoner, be well assured, that on
liue they shall not possesse the.” For credit and accomplishment of this
promisse, and in signe of his assured faith, he reached his right hand
to Sophonisba, and led hir into the inner lodging of the king’s Palace,
wher afterward Massinissa with himself considering how he might perform
hys promised faith, vexed and troubled with a thousand cogitations,
seing in a maner his manifest ouerthrow and ruine at hand, prouoked with
mad and temerarious loue, the very same day in open presence he toke hir
to wife, solemnizing that mariage, which afterwardes bred vnto hym great
vexation and trouble, meanynge by the same to haue dyscharged Sophonisba
from the Romanes rule and order. But when Lælius was come and hearde
tell thereof, hee fretted and chafed, and wyth threatnynge Wordes
commaunded Massinissa to send his new maried wife (as&nbsp;the booty and
pray of the Romanes) together wyth Syphax, to their captaine Scipio.
Notwithstanding, vanquished with the supplications and teares of
Massinissa, referring the matter wholy to the iudgement of Scipio, he
dispatched Syphax with the other prisoners and bootie, to the Romane
campe, and he himself remained with Massinissa for the recouerie of
other places of the kingdome, minding not to returne before the whole
prouince were brought vnder the Romane subiection. In the meane time
Lælius gaue intelligence vnto Scipio, of the successe of Massinissa his
mariage: who knowing the same to be so hastilye celebrated, was
maruellouslye offended and troubled in Minde, mutche maruellynge that
Massinissa woulde make sutch posthast before the comming of Lælius. Yea
and vpon the very first day of his entrie into Cirta, that hee would
consummate that vnaduised wedding: and the greater was Scipio his
displeasure towards Massinissa, for that the loue which he had conceiued
of that woman, was vnsemely and dishonest,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page242" id = "page242">242</a></span>
wondering not a little that he could not find out some Lady within the
region of Spain of semblable beauty and comlinesse, to please and
content his honest and commendable intent: wherfore he iudged Massinissa
his fact to be done out of time, to the preiudice and great decay of his
honor and estimation. Howbeit like a wise and prudent personage he
dissembled his conceiued gryefe, expecting occasion for remedye of the
same. Now the time was come that Lælius and Massinissa were sent for to
the Campe. But to declare the teares and lamentable talke, the great
mone and sighes vttered betwene this new maried couple, time would want,
and tediousnesse would ouercome the Reader. He had scarce lyen with his
beloued two or thre Nyghts, but Lælius (to&nbsp;their great grief and
sorow) claymed hir to bee hys prysoner. Wherfore verye sorowfull and
pensiue hee departed, and retourned to the Campe. Scipio in honourable
wyse accepted him, and openly before his Captaines and men of warre,
gaue thanks to Lælius and him, for theyr prowesse and notable exploites.
Afterwards sending for him vnto his Tent, he said vnto him: “I&nbsp;do
suppose (my&nbsp;dere frend Massinissa) that the vertue and beneuolence
which you saw in me did first of all prouoke you, to transfrete the
straits, to visite me in Spaine, wherein the good will of my valiaunt
frend Syllanus did not a little auaile, to sollicite and procure amity
betwene vs. And the same afterwards inducing your constant minde, to
retire into Affrica, committed both your selfe and all your goods into
my hands and keeping. But I well pondering the quality of that vertue
whych moued you thereunto, you beinge of Affrica, and I of Europa, you a
Numidian borne, and I a Latine and Romane, of diuers customes and
language different, thought that the temperance and abstinence from
venerial pleasures which you haue sene to bee in me, and experience
therof wel tried and proued, (for the which I render vnto the immortal
Gods most humble thankes) would or ought to haue moued you to follow
mine example, being vertues which aboue all other I doe most esteme and
cherish. For he that well marketh the rare giftes and excellent benefits
wherwith dame Nature hath arraied you, would thinke that ther should be
no lacke of diligence and trauell to subdue and ouercome the carnall
appetytes of temporal beauty:
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page243" id = "page243">243</a></span>
which had it bene applied to the rare giftes of nature planted in you,
had made you a personage to the posterity very famous and renoumed.
Consider wel my present time of youth, full of courage and youthly lust,
which contrary to that naturall race I stay and prohibite. No delicate
beauty, no voluptuous delectation, no feminine flattery, can intice my
youth and state to the perils and daungers whereunto that heedelesse age
is most prone and subiect. By which prohibition of amorous passions,
temperatly raigned and gouerned, the tamer and subduer of those
passions, closing his breast from lasciuious imaginations, and stopping
his eares from the Syrenes, and Marmaydes, of that sexe and kinde,
getteth greater glorye and fame, than wee haue gotten by our victory
agaynst Syphax. Hanniball the greatest ennimy that euer we Romanes felt,
the stoutest gentleman and captain without peere, through the delites
and imbracements of women effeminated, is no more the manlike and
notable emperor that hee was wont to be. The great exploits and
enterprises which valyantly you haue done in Numidia, when I was farre
from you, your care, readinesse, animosity, your strength and valor,
your expedition and bold attemptes, with all the reste of your noble
vertues worthy of immortal praise, I&nbsp;might and could perticulerly
recite, but to commend and extol them my heart and minde shall neuer be
satisfied, by renouacion wherof I should rather giue occasion of
blushing, than my selfe could be contented to let them sleepe in
silence. Syphax as you know is taken prisoner by the valyance of our men
of warre, by reason whereof, him selfe, his wife, his kingdome, hys
campe, landes, cities, and inhabitants, and briefly all that which was
king Syphax, is the pray and spoile to the Romane people, and the king
and his wife, albeit she was no Citizen of Carthage, and hir father,
although no captayn of our ennimies, yet we muste send them to Rome,
there to leaue them at the pleasure and disposition of the Romane Senate
and people. Doe you not know that Sophonisba with her toyes and
flatteries did alienat and withdraw king Syphax from our amitie and
friendship, and made hym to enter force of armes against vs? Be you
ignoraunt that she, full of rancor and malice aganyst the Romane people,
endeuoured to set al Affrica against vs, and now by her
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page244" id = "page244">244</a></span>
fayre inticementes hath gayned and wonne you, not I say our ennemy, but
an ennymy so farre as shee can, with her cruell Inchauntments? What
Damage and hurt haue lyghted vppon dyuers Monarches and Prynces through
sugred Lippes and Venemous Woordes, I&nbsp;wyll not spend tyme to
recite. With that prouocations and coniured charmes shee hath already
bewitched your good nature, I&nbsp;wyl not now imagine, but referre the
same to the deepe consideration of youre wisdome. Wherefore Massinissa,
as you haue bene a Conquerer ouer great nations and prouinces, be now a
conquerer of your own mind and appetites, the victorie whereof deserueth
greater prayse than the conquest of the whole world. Take heede I say,
that you blot not your good qualities and conditions, with the spots of
dishonor and pusillanimitye. Obscure not that fame which hitherto is
aduaunced aboue the Regyon of the glytterynge Starres. Let not thys vyce
of Femynine Flatterye spoyle the desertes of Noble Chyualrye, and
vtterly deface those merytes with greater ignomynie than the cause of
that offence is worthye of disprayse.” Massinissa hearynge these egree
and sharpe rebukes, not onely blushed for Shame, but bytterly Weepinge,
sayde: that hys poore prisoner and wyfe was at the commaundement of
Scipio. Notwithstanding, so instantly as Teares coulde suffer hym to
speak, he besoughte hym, that if it were possible, hee woulde gyue him
leaue to obserue hys faythe foolishlye assured, bicause hee had made an
othe to Sophonisba that with life shee shoulde not bee delyuered to the
Handes of the Romanes. And after other talke betweene them, Massinissa
retired to hys pauylyon, where alone wyth manifolde sighes, and most
bytter teares and plaintes, vttered wyth sutch houlinges and outcryes,
as they were hearde by those whych stoode neare hande, hee rested al the
daye bewailynge hys presente state: the most part of the nyghte also hee
spent with lyke heauynesse, and debating in hys mind vpon diuers
thoughts and deuises, more confused and amazed than before, hee could by
no meanes take rest: somtimes he thought to flee and passe the straights
commonly called the Pillers of Hercules, from thence to saile to the
Fortunate Islandes with his wife: then agayne hee thoughte with hir to
escape to Carthage, and in ayde of that City to serue agaynst the
Romanes, somtimes hee proposed
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page245" id = "page245">245</a></span>
by sworde, poyson, halter, or som such meanes to end his life and finish
his dolorous days. Many times hee was at pointe by prepared knife and
sworde to pierce his heart, and yet stayed the same, not for feare of
death, but for preseruation of his fame and honor. Thus thys wretched
and miserable louer burned and consumed in loue: tossing and tumbling
him selfe vppon his bedde, not able to find comfort to ease his payne,
thus began to say: “O&nbsp;Sophonisba, my deare beloued wyfe, O&nbsp;the
life and comfort of my life, O&nbsp;the deynty repast of my ioy and
quiet, what shall become of vs? Alas and out alas I crye, that I shall
see no more thine incomparable beauty, thy surpassyng comely face, those
golden lockes, those glistering eyes which a thousand times haue darkned
and obscured the rayes and beames of the Sunne it self: Alas I say, that
I can no longer be suffred to heare the pleasaunt harmonye of thy voice
whose sweetenesse is able to force Iupiter himselfe to mitigate his rage
when with lightning Thunderbolts and stormie claps in his greatest furie
he meaneth to plague the earth. Ah that it is not lawfull any more for
me to throw these vnhappy armes about thy tender neck, whose whitenesse
of face entermingled with semely rudds, excelleth the Morning Roses,
which by sweete nightly dewes doe sproute and budde. The Gods graunt
that I doe not long remaine on liue without thy sweete haunt and
company, which can no longer draw forth this breathing ghoste of myne,
than can a Bodye lyue wythoute like Breathe in it. Graunt (O&nbsp;Myghty
Iupiter) that one graue may close vs twaine to liue among the ghostes
and shadowes that be already past this world for like right louing
fitts, if intent of life be ment to mee without thy fellowship and
delectable presence. And who (O&nbsp;good God) shal be more blisful
amongs the Elysian fields, wandryng amids the spirites and ghostes of
departed soules, than I, if there we two may iette and stalke amonge the
shadowed friths and forests huge, besette with Mirtle trees, odoriferous
and sweete? that there we may at large recount and sing the sweete and
sower pangs of those our passed loues without anye stay or let at all:
that there I say we may remembre things already done, reioycing for
delights and sighing for the paines. There shall no harde hearted Scipio
bee found, there shal no marble minded captain rest, which haue not had
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page246" id = "page246">246</a></span>
regard of Loue’s toyes, ne yet haue pitied bitter payns, by hauing no
experience what is the force of loue. He then with ouer cruell wordes
shall not goe aboute to persuade me to forsake thee, or to deliuer thee
into the Romanes handes, to incurre miserable and most cruell bondage:
he shal there neuer checke me for the feruent loue I beare thee: we shal
there abide without suspition of him or any other: they can not seperate
vs, they be not able to deuide our sweetest companye. I&nbsp;would the
Gods aboue had graunted me the benefite, that hee had neuer arriued into
Affrica, but had still remayned in Sicilia, in Italy or Spayne. But what
stand I vpon these termes, O&nbsp;I fole and beast? what meanes my
drousie head to dreame sutch fansies? if he hadde not passed ouer into
Affrica, and made war against kinge Syphax, how should I haue euer seene
my faire Sophonisba, whose beauty farre surmounteth eche other wight,
whose comelines is withoute peere, whose grace inspeakable, whose maners
rare and incomparable, and whose other qualities generally disparcled
throughoute dame Nature’s mould by speach of man can not bee described?
If Scipio had not transfraited the seas to arriue in Affrike soile, how
should I, (O&nbsp;onely hope and last refuge of my desires) haue knowen
thee, neither should I haue bene thy feere, ne yet my wife thou
shouldest haue ben, but great had ben thy gaine and losse not much,
neuer shouldest thou haue felt the present painfull state, wherein thou
art, thy life (whereof most worthy no doubt thou art) shoulde not haue
lien in ballance poize, or rested in doubtfull plight, which now in
choyse of enimies thrall thou maist prolong, or else in Romanes handes a
praye or spoile by captiue state. But I beseech the gods to preuent the
choyce to be a Romane prysoner. And who can thinke that Scipio euer ment
to graunt me the life of one, and goeth about to spoile me of the same?
Did not he giue me the pardon of one, when he sent me to besiege the
City of Cirta, where I found fayre Sophonisba which is my Life?
A&nbsp;straunge kinde of pardon, by giuing me a pardon to dispossesse me
of the same. Who euer hard tel of such a pardon? So much as if he said
to me, thus: ‘Massinissa, go take the paine to cause the city yeld, and
ransack it by force, and I wil pardon thee thy lyfe. And not wyth the
onely benefit, but with Cræsus goods I wil inrich thee, and make thee
owner of
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page247" id = "page247">247</a></span>
the happy soyle of Arrabia, and when I haue so done and rased the walles
by myne indeuor, wherein myne onely lyfe and ioy did rest, at my
retourne for guerdone of that Noble fact, in steede of lyfe hee choppeth
of my head, and for fayre promyse of golden mountes, hee strips me
naked, and makes mee a Romane slaue: accordynge to whych case and state
he deales wyth me. For what auailes my Lyfe, if in gryefe and sorrowes
gulffe I drown the pleasures of the same? Doth not he berieue my life
and bredes my death by diuiding me from my fayre Sophonisba? Ah Caitife
wretch, what lucke haue I, that neither storme nor whirle Wynde could
sende him home to Italian shore, or set him packing to Sicile land? what
ment cruell Scipio, when so sone as Syphax was taken, he did not
streight way dispatch him to Rome, to present the glorious sight of the
Numidian king to the Romane people? If Scipio had not beene here, thou
Sophonisba frankly hadst bene mine: for at Lælias hands I could haue
found some grace: but surely if Scipio did once see Sophonisba, and
reclined his eyes to viewe hir perelesse beauty, I&nbsp;doubt not but he
would be moued to haue compassion vpon hir and me, and would iudge hir
worthy not onelye to be queene of Numidia but of all the prouince
besides. But what, do I make this good accompt? The common prouerbe
sayth, that he which counteth before his hoste, must recken twice: and
so perhaps may be my lot: for what know I if Scipio did wel view hir,
whether himselfe would be inamored of hir or not, and so utterly depriue
me of that Iewel? He is a man no doubt as others be, and it is
impossible me think, but that the hardnesse of his heart must bow to the
view of such a noble beauty. But (beast as I&nbsp;am) what mean these
wordes? what follies doe I vaunt by singing to the deafe, and teachyng
of the blynd? O&nbsp;wretch, wretch, nay more than myserable Wretch.
Marke the words of Scipio, he demaundeth Sophonisba, as a thing
belonging vnto him, for which cause he sayeth that she is the pray and
part of the Romane spoile: but what shall I do? shal I gyue hir vnto
hym? He wyll haue hir, hee constraynes me, he exhortes mee, hee prayes
mee, but I know full well wherevnto those intreaties tend, and vnder the
Grasse what lurking Serpent lieth. Shal I then put into his hands mine
own Sophonisba? But before I so
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page248" id = "page248">248</a></span>
doe, the armipotent God aboue, with his flashing fires and flamming
brands shall thunder me downe into the depthe of Hell. The gapyng ground
receiue my corps, before I yeld to that request, the trampling steedes
of sauage kinde do teare my members in thousand gobbets, the desert
beastes consume my flesh, the rauening gripes and carrain kites pick out
my tongue and eyes, before I glutte his rauenous mind with that demaund
to break the fayth which by holy othe I haue promised to performe.
O&nbsp;curssed caitif, but what shall I doe then? it behoueth to obey,
and in despite of my teeth to do that which the Romane Emperour
commaundeth. Alas, by thinking vpon that straight and needefull lot,
I&nbsp;die a thousand deaths: wherfore of euils to chose the least of
twaine, and to preserve my plighted faith, O&nbsp;swete Sophonisba, thou
must die, and by meanes of thy beloued feere, shalt voyd the yoke of
Romanes thral, for so it pleaseth vnmindeful Ioua to appoynt. The
wretched Heauens by cruel fate haue throwen their lot, that I of mine
owne mischiefe shal be the minister. And so (O&nbsp;life most deere)
I&nbsp;shall performe the effecte to kepe the fayth whych last of all
before thy face I did confirme.” By this speach and maner of talke, the
good Prince bewayled his case, excogitating by what meanes he myght doe
to death the thing which aboue al the world he loued best: at length it
came vnto his minde to sende hir a draught of poysoned drink, which
deuise he had no sooner founde, but he was driuen into a new kinde of
fury, and kindled with disdayne, his braynes were on fire with extreme
madnesse, and as though Sophonisba had bene before him, hee talked and
raued in Bedlemwyfe: somtimes with taunts he checked hir to hir teeth,
sometimes lamented hir vnfortunate state, sometymes with pawes
displayed, he seemed to rampe into hir face, and then agayne into
amorous toies his passions droue him forth. When I doe thinke what kinde
of a man Massinissa was, who in deede was a crowned and most noble king,
and who with sutch prudence gouerned his new conquered and recouered
kingdoms, and so constantly perseuered in amity of the Romane people,
I&nbsp;pray to God to graunt my frendes and myselfe also, not to enter
into so intricat and louesome Labyrinth, wherein this Noble Prince was
tangled, and wyth more temperaunce to gouerne

our beloued things. But<ins class = "addition" title =
"printed without space">&nbsp;</ins>retourning
gayne to this afflicted gentleman
Massinissa. He sent vnto his beloued wyfe and Queene a pot of poyson to
rid hir of hir life: but yet staying his messenger, he cried out these
words: <ins class = "addition" title = "open quote missing">“</ins>God
forbid that I should commit this infamous murder vpon hir whom I most
deerely loue, I&nbsp;would rather conuey hir into the extreme partes of
the vnknowen sandy Coaste of Libia, where the countrey is full of
venomous beasts and crawling poysoned Serpents, in which we shalbe safe
and sure from the danger of cruell and inexorable Scipio, by which
meanes he shall neuer see the rare and diuine beauty, which the serpents
once beholding, will mitigate and asswage their bitter poyson, and for
whose sake they will not annoy ne yet hurt me hir louing husband and
companion: wherefore let vs make hast to flee thither, to auoide the
bondage and death prepared for vs: and if so be we be not able to cary
with vs gold and siluer, yet shal we not want there some reliefe to
maintayn our liues: for better it is to feede on bread and water, then
to liue in perpetual thraldome. And liuing with thee (sweete wyfe) what
pouerty and beggery am not I able to sustayne? The stormes of exile and
penury, I&nbsp;haue already suffred: for beinge driuen out of my
kingdome many times, I&nbsp;haue repayred to obscure dens and caues,
where I haue hidden my selfe, and liued in the Wildernesse among the
sauage Beasts. But what meane I thus to say of my selfe, whom no
misaduenture can affray or myslyke? But thou deare wyfe whych hast ben
trayned vp and nourished amongs the delicacies and bankets of the Court,
accompanied wyth traynes of many fayre and noble ladies, lining lyke a
Queene in al kinde of pleasures and delights: what shall I doe wyth
thee? I&nbsp;know thy heart will not suffer thee to follow me, and yet
if the same would serue thee, from whence shall I procure present
shippinge? Vpon the Sea the Roman fleete beares swinge, vpon the land
Scipio wyth hys Army occupieth euery Coast, and is generall Lord of the
field. What then shall I most miserable and vnfortunate caitife do? for
whilest I am thus makinge my bitter playnts, the night is past away, day
light approcheth, and the bright shining mornyng begynneth to cleare the
earth. And behold yonder commeth the General’s messanger for Sophonisba,
whom I must eyther deliuer into his hands or

else commit her to present slaughter, beinge assured that she had rather
make choise to dy, than fall into the Laps of the cruell Romans.”
Whereupon he determined to send hir the poyson, and for very sorrow fell
downe vpon the ground like a man halfe deade. Afterwards being come
agayne to him selfe, he cursed the Earth, the Ayre, the Fyre, Heauen,
Hell, and all the Gods of the same, and exclaming in lamentable wyse he
called vnto him one of his most faithfull seruants, who according to the
custome of those dayes, alwaies kept poyson in store, and sayde vnto
him: “Receyue thys Cuppe of Golde, and deliuer the same with the poyson,
to Queene Sophonisba now abiding within the City of Cirta, and tel hir
that I with greatest good will would fayne haue kept the mariage knot,
and the firste fayth whych I plighted vnto hir, but the Lorde of the
Fielde, in whose power I am, hath vtterly forbidden the same.
I&nbsp;haue assayed all possible meanes to preserue hir my Wyfe and
Queene at liberty, but he which commaundeth me, hath pronounced such
hard and cruell sentence, as I am forced to offend my self, and to be
the minister of mine own mischief. Thys poyson I send hir with so
dolefull Message, as my poore hearte (God knoweth) doth only fele the
smart, being the most sorowfull present that euer was offred to any
fayre Lady. This is the way alone to saue hir from the Romanes handes.
Pray hir to consider the worthines of hir father, the dygnity of hir
countrey, and the royal maiesty of the <span class =
"smallroman">II.</span> kings hir husbands, and to do as hir mynd and
wil shall fansie best. Get the hence with all possible spede, and lose
no tyme to do thys Message: for thou shalt cary the bane and present
death of the fairest Ladye that euer Nature framed wythin hir fayrest
mould.” The seruaunt with this commaundment did departe, and Massinissa
lyke a Chylde beaten with the rodde, wept and cried. The messenger being
come to the Queene, and giuing hir the cup with the poyson, declared his
cruell ambassage. The Queene took the poysoned Cuppe, and sayd vnto the
messenger: “Geeue the king thy mayster myne humble thankes, and say vnto
hym, that I receyue and Drynke thys Poyson wyth a wyll so good, as if
hee had commaunded me to enter in Tryumph wyth Laurel Garlande ouer myne
ennymyes: for a better gifte a husbande can not gyue to wyfe,
<span class = "pagenum">

than accomplyshment of assured fayth the funeralles whereof shall bee
done wyth present obsequie.” And sayinge nothynge else vnto the
messenger, shee tooke the Cuppe, and mynglynge well together the poyson
wythin, shee vnfearfully quafft it vp: and when she had dronke it shee
delyuered the messenger hys Cuppe agayne, and layed hir selfe vpon hir
bed, commaunding hir gentlewomen in comely wyse to couer hir wyth
Clothes, and withoute lamentation or Sygne of feminine minde, shee
stoutly waighted for approching death. The Gentlewomen which wayted vpon
hir, bewayled the rufull state of their Maystresse, whose plaints and
scriches were heard throughout the palace, whereof the brute and rumor
was great. But the good Queene vanquished with the strong force of the
poyson, continued not long before she died. The messanger returned these
heauie newes vnto Massinissa, who so sorowfully complained the losse of
his beloued wife, in such wise as many tymes hee was lyke to kyll
hymselfe, that hys Soule might haue accompanied the ghost of hir, whych
was beloued of hym aboue all the dearest things of the Worlde. The
valyant and wyse capitayne Scipio vnderstanding the newes hereof, to the
intente Massinissa shoulde not commit any cruelty agaynst hymselfe, or
perpetrate other vncomely deede, called hym beefore him, and comforted
hym wyth the sweetest wordes he could deuise, and frendly reproued him.
The next day in the presence of al the army hee highly commended him,
and rewarded him wyth the kyngdome of Numidia, geuing hym many rych
Iewels and treasures, and brought hym in great Estimation amonges the
Romaynes: whych the Senate and people of Rome very well approued and
confirmed with most ample Priuileges, attributinge vnto hym the title of
kynge of Numidia, and freende of the Romaynes. Sutch was the ende of the
vnhappy loue of kynge Massinissa, and of the fayre and lucklesse Queene
Sophonisba.</p>

The cruelty of a Kynge of Macedone who forced a gentlewoman called
Theoxena, to persuade hir children to kill and poison themselves: after
which fact, she and hir husband Poris ended their lyfe by drowninge.</p>


<p><span class = "firstword">Bvt</span> now we haue beegon to treate of
the stoutnesse of certayne noble Queenes, I&nbsp;wyll not let also to
recite the Hystory of a lyke vnfearfull dame of Thessalian land, called
Theoxena, of right noble Race, the Daughter of Herodicus Prynce of that
Countrey in the tyme that Phillip the Sonne of Demetrius was kynge of
Macedone, tolde also by Titus Liuius, as two of the former be. Thys Lady
Theoxena, first was a notable example of piety and vertue and
afterwardes of rigorous cruelty: for the sayd kyng Philip, hauinge
through his wickednesse first murdred Herodicus, and by succession of
time cruelly done to death also the husbands of Theoxena and of Archo
hir naturall sister, vnto eyther of them being Wydowes remayninge a
Sonne: afterwardes Archo being maryed agayne to one of the principall of
their Countrey named Poris, of him she had many children. But when she
was dead, the sayd Lady Theoxena hir sister, who was of heart more
constant and stout than the other, still refused the second mariage,
although sued vnto by many great Lordes and Princes: at length pityinge
her nephewes state, for fere they should fall into the handes of some
cruell Stepdame, or that theyr father would not bryng them vp with sutch
diligence, as tyll that tyme they were, was contented to bee espoused
agayne to Poris, (no&nbsp;lawe that time knowen to defend the same) to
the intente she might trayne vp hir sister’s children as her owne. That
done she began (as&nbsp;if they were hir owne) to intreate and vse them
louingly, with great care and industrie: wherby it manifestly appeared
that she was not maried againe to Poris for hir owne commodity and
pleasure, but rather for the wealth and gouernement of those hir
sister’s children. Afterwards Philip king of Macedone, an vnquiet
Prince, determininge to make newe warres vpon the Romanes (then
throughout
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page253" id = "page253">253</a></span>
the worlde famous and renouned for theyr good fortune) exiled not onely
the chiefe and noble men, but almost al the auncient inhabitants of the
Cities along the sea coaste of Thessalia, and theyr whole and entier
families into Pæonia afterwards called Emathia, a&nbsp;Countrey farre
distant from the sea, giuing their voided Cities for the Thracians to
inhabite, as most propre and faithful for the Romains warres, which he
intended to make: and hearinge also the cursses and maledictions
pronounced against him by the banished people, and vniuersally by al
other, thought he was in no good surety, if he caused not likewyse all
the sonnes of them, whom a litle before he had slayne, to be put to
Death. Wherefore he commaunded them to be taken and holden vnder good
gard in prison, not to do them al to be slain at once, but at times now
one and then an other, as occasion serued. Theoxena vnderstanding the
edicte of this wicked and cruell king, and wel remembring the death of
hir husband, and of him that was husband to hir sister, knew wel that
hir sonne and nephew incontinently should be demaunded, and greatly
fearinge the king’s wrath, and the rigour of his guard, if once they
fell into theyr hands, to defend them from shame and cruelty, sodainly
applied hir minde vnto a straunge deuice: for shee durst to saye vnto
hir husband their father’s face, that soner she would kil them with hir
owne handes, if otherwise she coulde not warraunt them, then suffer them
to bee at the will and power of kinge Philip. By reason wherof Poris
abhorring so execrable cruelty, to comfort his wife and to saue hys
Chyldren, promysed hyr secretelye to transporte them from thence, and
caryed them himselfe to certayne of hys faythfull Fryendes at Athens,
whych done wythoute longe delaye, hee made as thoughe hee woulde goe
from Thessalonica to Aenias, to bee at the Solemnytye of certayne
Sacrifices, which yearelye at an appoynted tyme was done wyth greate
ceremonies to the honour of Ænêas the founder of that Citty, where
spendinge the time amonges other in solemne bankets, the <ins class =
"correction" title = "error for ‘thirde’">thrirde</ins> watch of the
night when euery man was a sleepe, as though he would haue returned home
to his countrey with his wyfe and children, priuely embarked himselfe
and them, in a ship hired of purpose to passe into Euboea, and not to
retourne to Thessalonica. But his intent was cleane altered and
chaunged, for his ship was no sooner vnder saile, but at that instant a
contrary winde and tempest
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page254" id = "page254">254</a></span>
rose, that brought him back againe, in despite of their labour, and all
the endeuour they were able to doe. And when daye lighte appeared, the
king’s garrison descried that shippe, and manned out a boate, to bring
in the same, which secretly they thoughte was about to escape away,
giuing them straight charge, that by no meanes they should returne
without hir. When the boate drew neare the shippe, Poris bent him self
to encourage the mariners to hoyse vp saile againe, and to make way with
their oares into the Sea, if it were possible, to auoide the imminent
and present daunger, to saue the life of him selfe, his wife and
children: then hee lyfted hys handes vp vnto the heauens to implore the
helpe and succor of the Gods, which the stoute Gentlewoman Theoxena
perceiuing, and manifestly seeing the Daunger wherein they were,
callinge to hir minde hir former determinate vengeance which she ment to
do, and beholding Poris in his prayers, she prosecuted hir intente,
preparing a poysoned drink in a cuppe, and made readye naked swordes: al
which bringing forth before the Childrens face, she spake these words:
“Death alone must bee the reuenge of your siely liues, wherunto there be
two wayes, poison or the sworde. Euery of you choose which ye list to
haue: or of whether of them your heart shall make the frankest choice.
The king’s cruelty and pride you must auoid. Wherfore deare children be
of good chere, raise vp your noble courage: ye the elder aged boyes,
shew now your selues like men, and take the sword into your handes to
pierce your tender hearts: but if the bloudy smart of that most
dreadfull death shal feare and fright your greene and vnripe age, then
take the venomed cup, and gulpe by sundry draghtes this poisoned drinke.
Be franke and lusty in this your destened Death, sith the violence of
Fortune, by Sea, doeth let the lengthning of your life. I&nbsp;craue
this requeste of choyse, and let not the same rebound with fearfull
refuse of thys my craued hest. Your mother afterwardes shal pass that
strayght, whereof she prayeth hir babes to bee the poastes: ye the vaunt
currours, and shee, with your louing sire, shall end and finishe
Philip’s rage bent agaynst vs.” When shee had spoken these woordes and
sawe the enimies at hand, this couragious dame, the deuiser of the
death, egged and prouoked these yong trembling children (not yet wel
resolued what to&nbsp;do) with her encharmed woords in sutch wyse, as in
the ende, some dranke the poyson, and
<span class = "pagenum">

other strake them selues into the body and by hir commaundement were
throwen ouer boord, not altogether dead, and so she set them at liberty
by death whom tenderly she had brought vp. Then she imbracing hir
husband the companion of hir death, both did voluntarily throw
themselues also into the sea: And when the kinge’s espials were come
aborde the ship, they found the same abandoned of theyr praye. The
cruelty of which fact did so moue the common people to detestatyon and
hatred of the kinge, as a generall cursse was pronounced against him and
his children, which heard of the Gods aboue was afterwardes terribly
reuenged vpon his stocke and posterity. Thys was the end of good Poris
and his stout wyfe Theoxena, who rather then she would fall into the
lapse of the king’s furie, as hir father Herodicus, and hir other
husbande did, chose violently to dye with hir own hands, and to cause
hir husband’s children and hir owne, to berieue them selues of Lyfe,
whych although agaynst the louinge order of naturall course, and
therefore that kinde of violence to bee abhorred, as horrible in it
self, yet a declaration of a stout mind, if otherwise she had ben able
to reuenge the same. And what coward heart is that, that dare not vpon
such extremity, when it seeth the mercilesse ennimy at hand, with
shining blade ready bent, to stryke the blowe, that withoute remedye
must ridde the same of breath, specially when it beholdeth the tremblyng
babe, naturally begotten by hys owne kinde and nature, before the face
imploryng father’s rescue, what dastarde heart dare not to offer
himselfe, by singular fight (thoughe one to twentye) either by desperate
hardinesse to auoyd the same, or other anoyance, aduenture what he can?
which in Christians is admitted as a comely fight, rather than wyth that
Pagane Dame to do the death it selfe. But now returne wee to describe a
fact that passeth al other forced deedes. For Theoxena was compelled in
a maner thus to do of meere constraint to eschue the greater torments of
a tyrant’s rage and thought it better by chosen death to chaunge hir
lyfe, than by violent hands of bloudy Butchers to be haled to the
slaughter. But thys Hidrusian dame was weary of hir owne life, not for
that she feared losse of lyfe, but desperate to think of Fortune’s
fickle staye: whych if fortune’s darlings would regarde in time, they
would foresee theyr slippery holde.</p>

<p class = "summary">
A straunge and maruellous vse, which in old time was obserued in
Hidrvsa, where it was lawfull, with the licence of a magistrate ordayned
for that purpose, for euery man, and woman that list, to kill them
selues.</p>


<p><span class = "firstword">Bandello</span> amonges the company of hys
Nouels, telleth this history: and in his own person speaketh these
words. If I should begin to tell those things which I saw in the tyme
that I sayled alongs the Leuant seas, very tedious it would be for you
to heare, and I in reporting could not tell which way to ende, bicause I
saw and heard thynges ryght worthy to bee remembred. Notwythstandinge,
for satisfaction of dyuers that be my frendes, I&nbsp;will not sticke to
reherse some of them. But first of all one straunge custome, whych in
the Romayes tyme was vsed in one of the Ilandes of the sea Ægeum, called
Hidrusa, in these dayes by the trauaylers called Cea or Zea, and is one
of the Ilandes named Ciclades, whilome full of Populous and goodly
Cities, as the ruins therof at this day do declare. There was in olde
time in that Iland a yery straunge lawe and ordynaunce, which many
hundred yeares was verye well and perfectly kept and observed. The Law
was, that euery person inhabitant within the sayd Isle, of what sexe and
condition so euer, being throughe age, infirmity, or other accidents,
weary of their lyfe, might choose what kind of death that liked them
best: howbeit it was prouyded that the partye, before the dooing of the
same, should manifest the cause that moued him therevnto, before the
Magistrate elected by the people for that speciall purpose, which they
constituted because they sawe that diuers persons had voluntarily killed
themselues vpon trifling occasions and matters of little importance:
according to whiche lawe very many Men and Women, hardily with so merry
chere went to theyr Death, as if they had gone to some bankette or
mariage. It chaunced that Pompeius Magnus the dreadfull Romane, betwene
whom and Iulius Cæsar were fought the greatest battailes for superiority
that euer were, sailing by the Sea Ægeum, arriued at Hidrusa, and there
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page257" id = "page257">257</a></span>
goynge a land vnderstoode of the inhabitantes the maner of that law and
how the same day a woman of great worship had obteined licence of the
Magistrate to poyson hir selfe. Pompeius hearing tell hereof, was driuen
into great admiration, and thought it very straunge, that a woman which
al the dayes of hir life had liued in great honour and estimation,
shoulde vpon light cause or occasion poyson her selfe sith it was
naturally giuen to ech breathyng wyght to prolong theyr liuing dayes
with the longest threede that Atropos could draw out of dame Nature’s
webbe. Whervpon he commaunded the said matrone to be brought before hym,
whose Death for hir vertue was generallye lamented by the whole
Countrye. When the gentlewoman was before hym, and had vnderstanding
that she was fully resolued and determined to dye, hee began by greate
persuasions to exhort hir, that she should not wilfully cast hir selfe
away, vpon consideration that she was of lusty yeares, riche and
welbeloued of the whole countrey: and how greate pitye it were but shee
shoulde renue hir Mynde and gyue hir selfe still to lyue and remayne,
till Natural course dyd ende and finysh hir life: howbeit his graue and
earnest persuasion could not diuert hir from hir intended purpose. But
Pompeius loth to haue hir dye, ceassed not styll to prosecute hys former
talke with newe reasons and stronger arguments. All which shee paciently
heard with fixed countenaunce, til at lengthe with cleare voyce and
smiling cheere she answered him in this maner: “You be greatly deceyued
(my&nbsp;lord Pompeius) if you do beleeue that I wythout very great
prouidence and mature aduise goe about to ende my dayes: for I do know
and am fully persuaded, that eche creature naturally craueth the
prolongation and lengthninge of lyfe, and so mutch abhoreth to die, as
the desirous to lyue detesteth the poyson whych I haue prepared for
consumation of my lyfe. Whereupon as I haue diuers times thought,
considered and discoursed with my selfe, and amongs many considerations
oftentimes debated in my minde, there came into the same the instability
and fickle change of Fortune, whose whirling wheele neuer ceasseth, ne
yet remayneth stedfast. It is dayly seene how she doth exalte and
aduaunce some man from the lowest and bottomlesse Pit, euen to the top
of high Heauens, endowinge him with so mutch Substaunce as he can
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page258" id = "page258">258</a></span>
desire. An other that was most happy, honoured in this world lyke a God,
vnto whom no goods and welfare were wantinge, who might wel haue bene
called in his lyfe, a&nbsp;three times happy and blessed wyght, sodaynly
from his honour and state depriued and made a very poore man and begger.
Some man also, that is both riche and lusty, accompanied with a fayre
wyfe and goodly Children, lyuinge in great mirth and ioylity, this
wicked Lady Fortune, the deuourer of all our contentations, depriueth
from the inestimable treasure of health, causeth the fayre Wyfe to loue
an other better than hir husbande, and with hir venomous Tooth biteth
the children, that in short space myserable death catcheth them al
within his dreadfull Clouches whereby he is defrauded of those children,
whom after his death he purposed to leaue for hys Heyres. But what meane
I to consume tyme and words in declaration of Fortune’s vnsteady stay,
which is more cleare than the beams of the Sunne, of whom dayly a
Thousande thousande examples be manifest: all histories be full of
theym. The mighty countrey of Græcia doth render ample witnesse wherein
so many excellent men were bred and brought vp: who desirous with their
finger to touch the highest heauen, were in a moment throwen downe: and
so many famous Cities, which gouerned numbers of people, now at this
present day we see to be thrall and obedient to thy City of Rome. Of
these hurtfull and perillous mutations (O&nbsp;noble Pompeius) thy
Romane City may be a most cleare glasse and Spectacle, and a multitude
of thy noble Citizens in tyme past and present, may geeue plentifull
witnesse. But to come to the cause of this my death, I&nbsp;say, that
fyndyng myself to haue liued these many yeares (by&nbsp;what chaunce I
can not tell) in very great prosperity, in al which tyme I neuer did
suffer any one myssehappe, but styll from good to better, haue passed my
time vntil thys daye: nowe fearyng the frownynge of Ladye Fortune’s
face, and that she will repente hir long continued fauour, I&nbsp;feare,
I&nbsp;say, least the same Fortune should chaung hir stile, and begynne
in the middest of my pleasaunt life to sprinckle hir poysoned
bitternesse, and make mee the Receptacle and Quiuer of hir sharpe and
noysome arrowes. Wherefore I am nowe determined by good aduyse, to rid
my selfe from the captivity of hir force, from all hir misfortunes,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page259" id = "page259">259</a></span>
and from the noysom and grieuous infirmities, which miserably be
incident to vs mortall Creatures: and beleeue me (Pompeius) that many in
theyr aged dayes haue left their life with little honour, who had they
bene gone in their youth, had dyed Famous for euer. Wherefore
(my&nbsp;lord Pompeius) that I may not be tedious vnto thee, or hinder
thyne affayres by long discourse, I&nbsp;besech thee to geeue me leaue
to follow my deliberate disposition, that frankely and freely I may be
vnburdened of all daunger: for the longer the life doth grow, to the
greater annoysaunce and daunger it is subiect.” When she had so sayd, to
the great admiration and compassion of all those which were present,
with tremblinge handes and fearefull cheare, she quaffed a great Cup of
poysoned drynke, the which she brought with hir for that purpose, and
within a while after dyed. This was the straunge vse, and order obserued
in Hidrusa. Which good counsel of the Dame had the noble and valiaunt
captayne followed, no doubt he would haue bin contented to haue bin
brought to order: and then he had not lost that bloudy battel atchieued
agaynst hym by Iulius Cæsar at Pharsalia in Ægypt. Then hee had not
sustayned so many ouerthrowes as he did, then had hee not ben forsaken
of his frendes, and in the ende endured a death so miserable. And for so
mutch as for the most part hitherto we haue intreated of many Tragicall
and bloudy chaunces, respyring now from those, let vs a little touch
some medicinable remedies for loue, some lessons for gouernment and
obedience, some treaties of amorous Dames, and hauty Gestes of Prynces,
Queenes and other persons, to variate the chaungeable diet, wherewyth

<p class = "summary">
The dishonest Loue of Favstina the Empresse, and with what remedy the
same loue was remoued and taken away.</p>


<p><span class = "firstword">True</span> and most holy is the sentence,
that the Lady, Gentlewoman, or other wyght of Female kinde, of what
degree or condition soeuer she be, be she fayre, fowle, or ylfauoured,
cannot be endued with a more precious Pearle or Iewell, than is the
neate and pure vertue of honesty: which is of sutch valour, that it
alone without other vertue, is able to render her that glistereth in her
attire, most famous and excellent. Be she more beautiful than Helena, be
she mightier than the Amazon, better learned than Sappho, rycher than
Flora, more louinge than Queene Dido, or more noble than the best
Empresse and Queene of the worlde, or be she full of any other vertue,
if she want the name of chast, shee is not worthy so mutch as to beare
the title of honour, nor to be entertayned in honest company. Yee shall
peruse hereafter an history of a Countesse of Celant, that was a passing
fayre Dame, singularly adorned with Nature’s gifts. She was fayre,
pleasaunt, amiable, comely, and perchaunce not altogether barrayne of
good erudition and learninge: she could play vpon the instruments, sing,
daunce, make and compose witty, and amorous Sonets, and the more her
company was frequented, the more amiable and gracious the same was
esteemed. But bicause she was unshamfast and lesse chaste, she was voyde
of honest regarde. Sutch as bee dishonest, do not onely hurt themselues,
but gieue cause to the common people to mutter and grudge at their
parentes education, at their husbands gouernment and institution of
their Children, causing them most commonly to leade a discontented and
heauy lyfe. Thinke you that Augustus Cæsar (albeit he was a victorious
Emperour, and led a triumphant raygne) liued a contented life when he
saw the two Iuliæ, one of them his daughter, the other his Niece, to vse
them selues like common strumpets, constrained through their shameful
acts to pin, and close vp himselfe, shunning the conuersation of men,
and once in minde to cut his Daughter’s Vaynes

to let out hir Lusty bloud? Was not he wont (the teares trickling downe
his Princely Face) to say, that better it was neuer to haue children and
to be deade without them, than to haue a fruteful wife and children so
disordred? He termed his Daughter to be a Carrion lumpe of fleshe, full
of stenche and filthinesse. But if I list to speake of women of this
age, from noble to vnnoble, from an Emperor’s Daughter to a Ploughman’s
modder, whose liues do frame after Iulia hir lore, my pen to the stumpes
would weare, and my hande be wearied with writing. And so likewise it
would of numbres no doubt in these dayes that folow the trace of Lucrece
line, that huswifely and chastly contriue the day and nightes in pure
and Godly exercise. But of the naughty sorte to speake, (leauing to
voyde offence, sutch as do flourish in our time) I&nbsp;will not
conceale the Empresse Messalina, that was Wyfe to the emperour Claudius,
not only vnworthy of Empresse degree, but of the title of Woman: who
being abused by many, at length arriued to sutch abhominable lust, as
not contented with dayly adulterous life, would resort to the common
stewes, where the ruffians and publike harlots haunted, for little hire,
and there for vilest price with eche slaue did humble herselfe: and at
night not satisfied, but weared, returned home to hir Palace, not
ashamed to disclose hir selfe to any that list to looke vpon hir: and
for victory of that beastly game, contended with her lyke. But not to
say so mutch of hir as I finde in Plinie his naturall history, in
Suetonius, and Cornelius Tacitus, I&nbsp;leaue hir to hir selfe, bycause
I haue made promise to remember the dishonest loue for example sake,
which I read of Faustina, whose beauty of al Writers is vouched to be
most excellent, if excellency of good life had thereunto ben coupled.
She was the daughter and wyfe of two holy and vertuous Emperours, the
one called Antonius Pius, the other Marcus Antonius. This
M.&nbsp;Antonius in all vertuous workes was perfect and Godly, and
singulerly loued his wife Faustina, and although she was infamous to the
world, and a Fable to the people, yet he cared not for the same, sutch
was the passing loue hee bare vnto hir. Leaue we to speake of hir
beastly behauiour amongs the noble sort, without regard vnto hir most
noble husbande, and come wee to treate of a certaine sauage kind of lust
she had to one of the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page262" id = "page262">262</a></span>
Gladiatores, whych were a certaine sort of Gamsters in Rome, which we
terme to be Maisters of defence. She was so far in loue with this
Gladiator, as she could not eat, drink, or slepe, ne take any rest. This
Faustina was so vnshamefast, as not regarding hir state, being as I
sayde before the daughter and wife of two most worthy Emperors,
dysdayned not to submitte her Body to the Basenesse of one of the vilest
sort, a&nbsp;Rascal Fencer, and many times would goe to Caieta,
a&nbsp;Citie and hauen of Campania, to ioyne hir selfe with the galye
slaues there. Hir husbande which loued her dearely, comfortying his
feble louing wyfe so well as he coulde, caused the best Physicians he
could finde, to come vnto hir for recouery of hir health. But all the
deuysed physike of the world was not able to cure her, she was so
louesicke. In the end knowing by long experience the fauour and loue hir
husband bare vnto hir, and knowing that nothing could withdraw his
continued minde, she tolde him, that al the torment and payne shee
sustained, was for the loue of a gladiator, towards whom hir loue was so
miserably bent, that except she had his company, death was the next
medicine for hir disease. The good husband whych beyond measure loued
his wife, comforted hir with so louing wordes as he could, and bad hir
to bee of good cheare, promisinge hee would prouide remedy. Afterwards
consulting with a wise man a Chaldee born, opened vnto him the effect of
his wiue’s disease, and how she was louesicke with sutch a person one of
the Gamsters of the City, promising great rewardes if he could by his
secretes serche out redresse to saue hir life. The Chaldee could tel him
none other remedy, but that he must cause the Gladiator to be slaine,
and with the bloud of him to anoint the body of the Empresse, not
telling vnto hir what the ointment was: which don, that he must goe to
naked bed to hir, and do the act of matrimony. Some Historiographers do
write, that the Chaldee gaue him counsell, that Faustina should drinke
the bloud of the Gladiator, but the most part, that hir body was bathed
in the same. But how so euer it was, it would haue cooled the hottest
Gentlewoman’s stomack in the world, to be anoynted with like Salue. To
conclud the Gladiator was slayne and the medicine made and applied to
the Pacient, and the Emperour lay with the Empresse,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page263" id = "page263">263</a></span>
and begat hir with childe. And immediatly she forgot the Gladiator,
neuer after that tyme remembring him. If this medicine were applied to
our carnall louinge dames (which God defend) they would not onely follow
Faustina in forgetfulnes, but also would mislike hir Phisike: and not
greatly regard the counsell of sutch doctours. By meanes of this
medicine and copulation was the Emperour Commodus borne, who rather
resembled the Gladiator than his Father: in whose breast rested a
storehouse of mischyefe and vyce, as Herodian and other Wryters
plentifully do wryte.</p>

Chera hid a treasure: Elisa going about to hang her selfe, and tying the

busily searching for the same, found the halter, wherewithal for

they be, debased so farre, as either infamously their lyfe is spent in
the hungry lap of Dame Penury, or else contriued in the vgly lothsom
house of Wantonnesse, the stepdame of all honesty and vertue. Sometimes
we marke the vnnoble ladde that was nooseled in the homely countrey
caban, or rude ciuile shoppe, attaine to that whych the onely honorable
and gentle do aspire: and he agayne that is ambicious in climbing vp the
turning wheele, throwen down beneth the brink of aduerse luck, whelmed
in the ditch and pit of black despaire. We note also sometimes that the
carelesse wyght of Fortune’s giftes, hath (vnlooked for) his mouth and
throte crammed full of promotion and worlde’s delights. Such is the
maner of hir fickle stay: whereof this History ensuing, gyueth some
intelligence, by remembring the destenied luck of 2 pore sory girles
that were left destitute of desired things, both like to fal into
despaire, and yet both holpen with that they most desired: which in this
sort beginneth. In the time that Scipio Affricanus had besieged the City
of Carthage, Chera that was a widow (dwellinge there) seeinge the
daunger at hand wherein the Citty stoode, and doubtynge the losse and
ouerthrowe of the same, and that the honor of the dames and womankinde,
coulde vneths be safe and harmelesse, determined not to abide the
vttermost: and hauinge a good quantity of Gold and precious stones, she
bestowed the same in a casquet, and hid it vpon one of the beames of hir
house,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page265" id = "page265">265</a></span>
purposinge when the stir and daunger was past, to retourne to hir house
agayne for those hir hidden things. Which done, in the habite of a poore
woman with her onely daughter in hir hand that was about 5 or 6 yeares
of age, she went out of Carthage, and passed ouer the Seas into
Scicilia, where falling sicke, after she had bene there three or foure
yeares, at length died. But before shee departed, shee called her
Daughter before hir, then about Ten yeares olde, and told hir the place
where she had layed hir Casket. And by reason of the victory gotten by
Scipio, the city was maruellously chaunged, and amongs other things, the
house of Chera was giuen to a Romane Souldiour that was so enriched with
Nobilyty of Mynd, as hee was poore of Fortune’s Goods. Whych Chera
vnderstandyng, was sorowfull, and doubted of hir thynges secretlye
bestowed vppon the beame. Wherevpon she sayd vnto hir daughter, that for
so much as their house was in the possession of an other, she ought to
be wise and circumspect in the recouerye of hir hidden goods: and that
hir death was the more greuous vnto hir, because she must leaue hir
(so&nbsp;yong a maiden) vnprouided of frendes for hir good gouernement.
But yet she incouraged hir againe and sayd: that sith necessity
approched, she must in childyshe age, put on a graue and auncient minde,
and beware howe shee bewrayed that casket to any person, for that of
purpose shee reserued the knowledge thereof, to hir self, that it might
serue for hir preferment, and procure hir a husband worthy of hir selfe.
And the maiden demaundinge the value of the same, shee told hir that it
was worth <span class = "smallroman">CC.</span> Talentes, and gaue hir
in writing the particulars inclosed within the Caskette, and that the
lyke bill shee should find within the same, written wyth hir owne Hande.
And so the good woman within a while after dyed, leauyng behynde hir the
yong mayden hir daughter, that maruellously lamented the death of hir
mother, accordingly as nature taught hir, and ech other reasonable wyght
depriued from their dearest friends. The maiden for hir yeres was very
wise, and would disclose to none what her mother had sayd, keeping the
writing very carefully. Not long after Philene (whych was the maiden’s
name) fell in loue with a Gentleman of Scicilia of greate reputation and
authority, who al bee it he saw hir to be very faire and comely,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page266" id = "page266">266</a></span>
yet cared not for hir loue in respect of Maryage, for that hee knewe hir
to bee poore, and withoute dowrie mete for a Gentleman, iestyng and
mocking to see hir fixe hir minde on him, for desyre to haue him to hir
husbande, that was a personage so noble and rich: which refusall pierced
the hearte of the tender maiden, bicause she saw hir selfe forsaken for
nothynge else, but for want of goods: whych made hir to think and
consider, howe shee myght recouer the riches that hir mother had layed
vp in Carthage. It chaunced as she was in this meditation, the daughter
of him to whome the House of Chera was giuen, called Elisa, was likewise
enamoured of a noble yong gentleman in Carthage, who bicause Elisa was
the daughter of a Souldiour, and not very rich, in like manner laughed
and iested at hir loue, no lesse than the other did at Philene.
Notwithstanding Elisa attempted al meanes possible to induce the yong
man to loue hir, but hir practise and attemptes tended to none effect.
And last of all, desirous to haue a resolute answere, and thereby
vnderstode, that he would rather dye than take hir to Wyfe, she fell
into despayre and curssed fortune, and hir fate, that she was not borne
riche enough to match wyth hir chosen Gentleman, and that she being
poore, must fall in loue wyth sutch a personage: whereupon she miserably
tormented hir selfe, still bewaylinge hir vnhappy lucke, that shee could
not win him to be hir husband, for whych only intent and purpose she
loued him. And this amorous passion incredibly growing in hir, the
rootes whereof be planted in the restlesse humor of melancholy, and
wanting all hope and comforte to stay that Ranke and Rammishe weede, it
so increased in her, as shee franticke in raging loue gaue hir selfe
ouer to the spoyle of herself: and to rid her from the griefe, she
determined to kill hir selfe, imagining whych way she might do the same.
At length she was resolued, with hir father’s sword to peerce hir body:
but hir heart not seruing hir thereunto, deuised by the halter to end
her lyfe, saying thus to herselfe: “Thys death yet shal do me good, that
the cruel man may know that for his sake I haue done this fact: and if
his heart be not made of Iron or steele, he can not chose but sorrowe
and lament, that a poore mayde whych loued him better than hir owne
lyfe, hath made sutch wretched
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page267" id = "page267">267</a></span>
ende onely for his cruelty.” Elisa concludinge vpon this intent,
prepared a Halter: and being alone in her house, in the chamber where
the Casket lay vpon the beame, placed a stoole vnder the same, and began
to tye the halter about the beame: in doinge whereof, she espied the
casket, and reached the same vnto hir, who feeling it to be heauy and
weighty, immediatly did open it, and founde the Byll within, which Chera
had written with hir owne hand, agreable to that which she had deliuered
to hir daughter, wherein were particularly remembred the Iewels and
other riches fast closed within the casket. Who disclosing the bagges
wherein the gold and Iewels were bound vp, and seeing the great value of
the same, wondred thereat, and ioyfull for that fortune, hid the rope
which she had prepared for hir death, in the place where she found the
casket, and with great gladnesse and mirth went vnto hir father, and
shewed him what she had found, whereat the father reioyced no lesse,
then his daughter Elisa did, bicause he sawe himselfe thereby to be
discharged of his former poore life, and like to proue a man of
inestimable wealth and substance: and saw likewise that the poore wench
his daughter, by the addicion of those riches, was like to attayne the
party whom shee loued. When he had taken forth those bagges and well
surueyed the value, to the intent no man might suspect the sodayne
mutation of his state, tooke his daughter with him, and went to Rome,
where after he had remayned certayne monethes, hee returned to Carthage,
and began very galantly to apparell himselfe, and to keepe a bountifull
and liberall house. His table and port was very delicate and Sumptuous,
and hys Stable stored wyth many fayre Horsse, in all poynctes sheewinge
himselfe very Noble and rich: by which sodayne chaunge of state, the
whole Citty beleeued that he had brought that wealth from Rome. And
bicause it is the common opinion of the vulgar sort, that where there is
no riches, there is no nobility, and that they alone make men noble and
gentle (a&nbsp;foolyshe Opinion in deede proceedinge from heads that be
rash and light) the people markynge that porte and charge kept by the
Souldiour, conceyued that he was of some noble house. And throughout the
whole Citty great and solemne honour was done vnto him: whereupon the
young Gentleman, with whom
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page268" id = "page268">268</a></span>
Elisa was in loue, began to bee ashamed of himselfe, that he had
disdayned the mayden. Whych mayden seeing hir Father’s house to be in
sutch reputation, made sute to her father, that he would procure the
Gentleman to bee hir husband. But hir father wylled hir in any wyse to
keepe secret hir desire, and not to seeme her selfe to bee in loue, and
wysely tolde hir, that more meete it was that she should bee solicited
by him, than shee to make sute or request for mariage: alleaginge that
the lesse desirous the gentleman had bene of hir, the more deare and
better beloued shee shoulde be to hym. And many tymes when hys Daughter
was demaunded to Wyfe, he made aunswere that matrimony was a state of no
litle importance, as enduring the whole course of Lyfe, and therefore
ought well to bee considered and wayed, before any conclusion were made.
But for all these demaundes and aunswers, and all these stops and
stayes, the mayden was indowed with an honest dowry, and in the end her
louer and she were maried, with so great pleasure and satisfaction of
them both, as they deemed themselues happy. In the meane time while
these things were done at Carthage, Philene in Scicilia toke thought how
she might recouer her goods geuen to her by her mother, desirous by
their meanes also to sort hir earnest and ardent loue to happy successe.
And debatinge with her selfe (as&nbsp;we haue sayd before) howe she
might obtayne them, because the house was in possession of an other,
thought it to bee agaynst reason and order, that although she had lost
hir house, yet hir goods ought to be restored vnto hir, which were hir
onely mayntenance and reputation, and the fittest instrument that should
conduct her loue to happy ende. And hearinge tell that the Father of
Elisa the possessor of hir mother’s house liued at Carthage in great
royalty and magnificence, thought that if by some sleight and pollicie
she founde not meanes to enter the house without suspicion, hir attempt
would be in vayne: determined therefore to goe to Carthage, and to seeke
seruice in that house, counterfaytinge the kynde and habite of a Page.
For she considered, that if she went thither in order and apparell of a
mayden, she should incur the perill of her virginity, and fall into the
lapse of diuers other daungers, purposed then to go thyther in maner of
a Page and lacky. And
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page269" id = "page269">269</a></span>
when she had in that sort furnished hirselfe, she passed the Seas, and
arriued at Carthage. And seekinge seruice about the City at length
chaunced to be retayned in a house that was next neyghbour to the
Souldier, and bicause this wench was gentle and of a good disposition,
was wel beloued of her maister, who being the frend of Elisa, hir Father
many times sent vnto him diuers presents and gifts by Philene,
wherevppon she began to be acquainted and familiar with the seruantes of
the house, and by her oft repayre thyther viewed and marked euery
corner, and vpon a time entred the chamber wherein hir Mother Chera <ins
class = "correction" title = "‘t’ missing">olde</ins> hir, that shee had
bestowed hir goods, and lookinge vpont the Beames espied by certayne
Signes and tokens, one of them to be the same where the Casket lay: and
therewithal wel satisfied and contented, verily supposed that the casket
still remayned there, and without further businesse for that time,
expected some other season for recouery of the same. In the ende, the
good behauiour and diligence of Philene, was so liked of Elisa, as hir
father and she made sute to hir maister to giue hir leaue to serue them,
who bycause they were his friends, preferred Philene vnto them, and
became a page of that house. And one day secretly repayrynge into the
chamber, where the treasure lay mounted vppon a stoole, and sought the
beame for the casket: where she found no casket, but in place where that
lay, the halter, wherwithal Elisa woulde haue strangled hir self. And
searching all the parts of the Chamber and the beames, and finding
nothing else but the halter, she was surprised with sutch incredible
sorrowe, as she seemed like a stock, without spiryte, voice or life.
Afterwardes, being come againe to hir selfe, shee began pitifully to
lament and complayn in this maner: “Ah wretched Philene, vnder what
vnluckie signe and planet was thou begotten and borne? wyth what offence
were the heauens wroth, when they forced thee to pierce thy mother’s
wombe? Could I poore creature when I was framed within the moulde of
nature, and fed of my mother’s substance within hir wombe, and
afterwards in due time brought forth to light, commit such crime, as to
prouoke the celestiall impressions to conspire agaynst my Natiuity, to
brynge mine increased age into such wretched state and plighte wherein
it is now
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page270" id = "page270">270</a></span>
wrapped? No, no, my faulte was nothing, it was parent’s offence, if any
were at all: for many times we see the innocent babe afflicted for the
father’s guilt. The Gods do punish the posterity, for som sacrilege or
notorious crime committed by progenitors: theyr manner is not to suffer
heynous faultes vnreuenged: their iustice cannot abide such mischief
vncorrected for example sake: so fareth it by me. First my father died,
after wardes my Mother a widow was driuen to abandon natiue soyle, and
seeke reliefe in forrain land: and leauing that wherwith we were
possessed in enimies keping, were forced a simple life to leade among
straungers. And my mother, yelding forth hir ghost, made me beleue that
shee had hidden great treasures here: and I vnhappy wench thinking to
obteine the pray, haue wandred in counterfeit kind, and fetcheed many a
bitter sigh, vntil I came into this place: and the thing I hoped for,
which myght haue bene the meanes and ende of all my care, is turned to
nothyng: a&nbsp;casket transformed into a halter: gold and Iewels into a
piece of rope? Is this the mariage dowry (Philene) thou art like to haue
to match with him whom thou so derely louest? Is this the knot that
shall conioyne you both in yoke of man and wife? Ah wretch and miserable
caitife, the goods thy mother layd vp for thee, for maintenance of thy
rest, and safegarde of thine honour, and for the reputation of thy noble
house, wherof thou camst, is now berieued from thee: they that kepe this
stately house, and beare their lofty port amid the best, haue despoiled
thee pore wench of that after which thou didst vainly trauayle. But what
remedye now? sith thy wicked lot doth thus fall out, sith thy cruel fate
is loth thou shouldest atteine the thing on whych thy mind is bente, and
sith thy painfull lyfe can take no ende, make spede to rid thy selfe
from misery by that meanes which he hath prepared for thee that hath
found thy goods: who seeing his good aduenture to be thy bane, his happy
pray to bee thy spoyle, hath left in lieu of treasure, a&nbsp;halter,
that therwith thou mightest dispatch thy selfe from all thy griefes, and
in their vnhappye companye to cease thy life, that the lothsom,
lengthning of the same might not increase thy further plaints, sorowes,
anguish and affliction. And in the place where infortunate Philene toke
hir beginning, ther the Miserable wretche must finishe that,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page271" id = "page271">271</a></span>
which without hir desired gaine no longer can be maynteined.
Peraduenture it may come to passe as when thy soule is losed from this
mortall charge, it shall stalke by hym, by whom it liueth, and by him
also whom she thought to ioy in greatest contentation that euer mortall
woman did.” And thus plaininge and sighing hir il fortune, when she had
ended those words she tyed the halter about the beame, where sometimes
hir Treasure lay, which beyng done shee put the same about hir necke,
sayinge: “O&nbsp;crooked Lady Fortune, that hast thus vnfrendly dealt
with thine humble clyent: Ah dispayre, thou vgly wretch and companion of
the distressed that is vnwillinge to leaue my haunte vntyll thou playe
the Hangman. Ah Dyuell incarnate that goest aboute to hale and plucke
the innocent into thy hellish caue. Out vppon the thou deformed hellish
dogge, that waitest at the fiery gate to lette them in, which faine
would passe an other porte.” And as shee was powrying forth these
spitefull wordes, redy to remove the stoole to fetch hir swynge, the
Gods which would not giue consent, that the innocent wench should enter
that vile and opprobrious death, moued the heart of Elisa, to passe by
the place where she was in workynge on her selfe that desperate end: who
hearing those moneful plaints vttred after such terrible manner, opened
the Chamber doore, and saw that myserable sight: and ignorant of the
occasion, moued with pity, ranne and stayed hir from the fact, saying
thus vnto hir: “Ah Philene,” (whych was the name that she had giuen to
hir selfe) “what folie hath bewitched thy mind? What phrensie hath
incharmed thy braine? What harde aduenture hath moued thee in this
miserable wise, to ende thy life?” “Ah” (sayd Philene) “suffer me Elisa,
to finish my tormentes: giue me liberty to vnburden myselfe from the
bande of cares that do assaile me on euery side: lette these Helhoundes
that stande heare rounde about mee, haue theyr praye for which they
gape. Thou moued by compassion, arte come hither to stay mee from the
Halter: but in doyng so, thou doest mee greater wrong, than doeth
despayre whych eggeth me therunto. Suffer I say, that mine afflictions
may take some end, sith cruel fortune willeth it to be so, or rather
vnhappy fate: for sowre death is sweeter in my conceit, than bitter life
contriued in sharper sauce than gall or wormwood.”
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page272" id = "page272">272</a></span>
Elisa hearing her speake these wordes, sayd: “For so much as thy myshap
is such, as onely death is the nearest remedy to depriue thy payne, what
wicked chaunce hath induced thee, in this house to finish those thy
miseries? What hath prouoked the to sutch augury to this our most happy
and ioyfull family?” “Forced is the partye” (sayd Philene) “so to doe
when destenye hath so appointed.” “What desteny is that?” demaunded
Elisa. “Tell mee I beseech thee, perchaunce thou mayst preuent the same
by other remedy than that whereabout thou goest.” “No,” (answered
Philene) “that is impossible, but to satisfie thy request which so
instantly thou crauest of me, I&nbsp;wil tel thee the summe of al my
miserie.” In saying so the teares gushed forth hir eyes, and hir voice
brake oute into complaints, and thus began to say: “Ah Elisa, why should
I seke to prolong my wretched life in this vale of wretchednesse,
wherein I haue ben so miserably afflicted? my mother pitieng mine estate
and seeynge me voide of frends, and a fatherlesse child vpon hir death
bed, disclosed vnto me a treasure which she had hidden vpon this beam
whervnto this halter (the best remedy of my misery) is tied: and I
making serch for the same, in place of that treasure found this halter,
ordeined as I suppose (by&nbsp;what misfortune I knowe not) for my
death: and where I thought among the happy to be the most happy,
I&nbsp;see my selfe amongs al vnlucky women to be the most vnfortunate.”
Elisa hearing hir say so, greatly maruelled and sayd: “Why then I
perceiue thou art a woman and not a man.” “Yea, truly,” answered the
vnhappy mayden: “A&nbsp;singuler example of extreme misery to all sortes
of women.” “And why so?” demaunded Elisa. “Bicause” (answered Philene)
“that the pestilent planet vnder which I was borne, will haue it to be
so.” And then she told hir al that which had chaunced from the time of
hir mother’s departure out of Carthage, and how she went into Scicilia
and recounted vnto hir the loue that she bare to a Scicilian Gentleman,
and howe that he disdayning hir for hir pouerty, refused to be hir
husband: whervpon to atchieue hir desire as loth to forgoe him, was come
in maner of a page to Carthage, to recouer the riches which hir Mother
had hidden there, to the intente she might obtaine (if&nbsp;not by other
meanes) with som
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page273" id = "page273">273</a></span>
rich dowrie, the yong Gentleman to husband whom she so dearely loued.
And then reenforcing hir complaint, she said: That sith Fortune had
despoiled hir of that which might haue accomplished hir desire, resting
no cause why she should any longer liue, the halter was prepared for hir
to end her daies, and to rid hir life from troubles. And therefore she
praied hir to be contented, that she might make that end which hir
misaduenture and wicked fortune had predestinate. I&nbsp;doubt not but
there be many, which vnderstanding that the treasure did belong to
Philene, if they had found the like as Elisa did, would not onely not
haue forbidden hir the Death, but also by speedy meanes haue hastened
the same, for so mutch as by that occasion the hidden treasure should
haue ben out of strife and contention: so greate is the force of
couetousnesse in the minde of man. But good Elisa knew ful wel the
mutability of Fortune in humaine thinges, for so mutch as she by seeking
death, had fonde the thinge which not onely deliuered hir from the same,
but made hir the best contented woman of the worlde. And Philene
seekinge hir contentation, in place thereof, and by like occasion, found
the thinge that would haue ben the instrument of hir death, and moued
with very great compassion of the mayden, desired to haue better
aduertisement howe that treasure could belong to her. Then Philene
shewing forth hir mother’s writing, which particularly remembred the
parcels within the casket, and Elisa seeinge the same to be agreeable to
the hand wherewith the other was written that was founde in the casket,
was assured that all the gold and Iewels which she had found, did belong
vnto Philene, and sayd vnto hirselfe: “The Gods defend that I should
prepare the halter for the death of this innocent Wench, whose
substaunce hath yelded vnto mee my hart’s desire.” And comforting the
mayden, in the ende she sayd: “Be contented Philene, and giue ouer this
thy desperate determination, for both thy lyfe shalbe prolonged, and thy
discontented minde appeased, hoping thou shalt receyue the comforte thou
desirest.” And with those words she losed the halter from hir neck, and
takinge hir by the hand, brought hir to the place where hir Father and
husband were, and did them to vnderstand the force and terms whereunto
the fier of loue and desperation had brought that amorous mayden:
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page274" id = "page274">274</a></span>
tellinge them that all the treasure and Iewels which she had found
(where she left the halter, and wherewith Philene was minded to hang hir
selfe) did by good right and reason belonge to hir: then she did let
them se the counterpayne of that bill which was in the casket, in all
points agreeable thereunto, declaringe moreouer that verye lyke and
reasonable yt were, like curtesie should bee vsed vnto her, as by whom
they hadde receyued so greate honoure and delyghte. Her husband which
was a Carthagian borne, very churlishe and couetous, albeit by
conferring the writings together, he knewe the matter to be true, and
that Philene ought to be the possessor thereof, yet by no meanes would
agree vnto hys wyue’s request, but fell into a rage, callinge hir Foole
and Ideot, and sayinge that hee had rather that shee had bene a
Thousande tymes hanged, than he would giue hir one peny: and although
she had saued hir life, yet she ought to be banished the Citty, for so
mutch as the same and all the propertie thereof was brought into the
Romane’s handes, and amongs the same hir mother’s house, and al hir
goods in possession of the victors, and euery part, at their disposition
and pleasure. And moreouer, for so mutch as hir mother and shee had
departed Carthage, and would not abide the hazarde and extremity of
their country as other Citizens did, and hauing concealed and hidden
those riches which ought to haue ben brought forth for the common
defence of their countrey, and gone out of the Citty as though she had
ben a poore simple Woman, poorely therefore she ought to lyue in
Scicilia, whyther she was fled. Wherefore he was of opinion, that she in
this maner beinge departed when the Citty had greatest neede of hir
helpe, was disfranchised of all the rightes and customes of the
countrey, and that like as a straunger can recouer nothinge in that
Citty, except he haue the priuiledge and Freedome of the same, euen so
Philene (for the considerations before recited) ought to be compted for
a straunger, and not to participate any thinge within the City,
accordingly as the lawes forbid. When he had so sayd, he was like by
force to expell the sorrowfull mayden out of the house. These wordes
greatly grieued Philene, who doubted least his father in law would haue
ioyned with him, and agree vnto hys alleaged reasons, whych seemed to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page275" id = "page275">275</a></span>
be of great importaunce and effect: and therefore thought newly to
returne to the Halter for remedy of hir griefes; but it otherwise
chaunced, for the Father of Elisa, which was a Romane borne, and
affected with a Romane minde, and therefore of a Gentle and well
disposed nature, knew ful wel, that although the house was giuen vnto
him by the consent of Scipio, and other the Captaynes, yet he knew that
their pleasure was not to bestowe on him the treasure hidden in the
same, and therefore ought to be restored to the true owner, or else
confiscate and properly due to the Romane Eschequer, or common treasure
house of the same: and albeit that it was true that hir Mother went out
of Carthage, in the time of the Siege, and therefore had forfayted the
same, yet he determined to shewe some curtesie vnto the younge mayden,
and to be thankfull to fortune, for the benefite which by hir meanes he
had receyued, thinkinge that she would be displeased with him, if he
with vngratefull minde or dishonourable intent should receyue hir
giftes. For in those dayes the Romans highly reuerenced Lady Fortune,
and in hir honour had Erected Temples, and Dedicated Aultars, and in
prosperous tyme and happy aduentures, they consecrated vowes, and
sacrifices vnto hir, thinkinge (although supersticiously) that like as
from God there proceeded none euil, euen so from him all goodnesse was
deriued: that all felicity and other good happes, whych chaunced vppon
the Romane Common wealth, proceeded from Fortune, as the Fountayne and
most Principall Occasion, and that they which would not confesse hir
force, and be thanckful vnto hir Godheade, incurred in the ende hir
Displeasure and Daungers very great and haynous. This Romane then hauing
this opinion, beinge (as&nbsp;I sayd before) of a gentle Disposition
woulde at one instant both render thankes to Fortune, and vse curtesie
vnto that mayden, by whose riches and goods from lowe degree he was
aduanced to honourable state. Wherefore turning his Face vnto hir, with
louing countenaunce he spake these wordes: “Right gentle damosel, albeit
by the reasons alleged by my sonne in law, none of the treasure hidden
by thy mother, and founde by my Daughter in thys house, of right doth
appertayne to thee, yet I will that thou shalte vnderstande my curtesie,
and that thou see how the Romanes
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page276" id = "page276">276</a></span>
doe more esteeme the nobility of their minde, than all the riches of the
world. Therefore that thou mayst enioy thy loue, I&nbsp;referre vnto
thee and to thy disposition all the goods and Iewels that were in the
Casket, and contayned in thy writinge. Beholde therefore (causing the
casket to be brought vnto him) all the Iewels and other parcels that
were in the same when they were founde, take so mutch thereof as thou
wilt, and if so bee thou desire the whole, willingly I render the same
vnto thee, sithens by means of those riches, and the industry of my
trafique, I&nbsp;haue gayned so mutch, as hauinge gyuen a conuenient
dowry vnto my daughter, I&nbsp;honorably liue without it.” Philene
seeing the curtesie of this valiaunt gentleman, gaue him infinite
thanks, and then sayd vnto him: “Sir, I&nbsp;for my part dare aske
nothinge, well knowinge that if you geue me nothinge, there is no cause
why I shoulde complayne of you, but of my hard and wicked fortune, whych
hath offered and giuen that to you, which ought to haue bin mine.
Wherefore, sith your curtesie is sutch, as you refer the whole to mee,
I&nbsp;purpose to take nothing, but will that the whole shall bee in
your disposition, and giue mee what you list, and that so gieuen of your
liberality, I&nbsp;shal more thankfully receiue, than if debt or duty
did constrayne it: and if it shall please you to giue me nothing, my
heart shal bee so well appeased, for that your curtesie, as rather
woulde I chose to liue in the poore estate wherein I am, than be rych
with your displeasure.” Howbeit, the Romayne intreated Philene to take
thereof what shee thought good: and Philene craued no more than it
pleased hym to gyue. Eyther of them standinge vpon these termes Elisa,
brake the strife, who knowinge the force of loue, and the griefes
incident to his clients, by hir own harmes, moued to haue compassion
vpon the afflicted, turned towardes hir father, and sayd vnto him:
“Right louinge father, the contencion betweene Philene and you, is risen
of a matter which came by me. The treasure for which you striue, and
committed to the will of Philene, was found by me, whereof if it please
you both, I&nbsp;wyll take sutch order, as both you shalbe satisfied.”
“I&nbsp;am contented,” sayd hir father: “And I likewise,” aunswered
Philene. Then sayd Eliza: “You father hitherto haue had but one
Daughter, which
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page277" id = "page277">277</a></span>
am I, vnto whom like a chylde and louinge daughter I haue bene obedient,
and shalbe all the dayes of my lyfe: and I agayne haue receiued from you
sutch fatherly education, as your ability and state required. This
treasure I found and gaue to you for ease and comfort of vs both: to me
it yelded the only delectation of my heart in choyse of husband: to you
honour and estimation within thys Citty. Wherefore, sith the principal
came from me, and the right resteth in this careful maiden, my desire
is, that where before you had but one daughter, you will adopt this
mayden for another, and thinke that you have twaine, and that you will
intreate Philene in like sort as if shee were my sister: and where this
Inheritance and reuenue wherewith now you be possessed, and this casket
also ought to be onely myne after your decease, for that you haue no
sonnes, nor other Issue, my desire is that you geue vnto her the halfe,
and that you accept hir for your daughter, as I doe meane to take hir
for my sister: and accordingely to vse hir duringe lyfe.” With these
wordes Elisa imbraced Philene, and louingly dyd kisse hir, sayinge vnto
hir: “For my sister I entertayn thee Philene.” And then shee tooke hir
by the hand and gaue hir vnto hir father with these wordes: “Beholde
father, your new daughter, whom I beseech you so hartily to loue as you
do Elisa your naturall chylde.” The father praysed the curtesie of
Elisa, and receiued Philene for his daughter and was contented wyth the
Arbitrament of his Daughter. But Elisa perceyuing hir husband to be
somewhat offended therewyth, specially for that the same should be
deuided into two partes, which was like to haue bene hys wholly before,
persuaded hym by gentle meanes to be content wyth that agreement: and
although at the first he could not well brooke the liberality of his
wyfe, yet at length viewinge the good behauiour and gentle disposition
of Philene, and the contented minde of his father in law, together with
the noble nature of his wyfe, and hir wise aduertisement of Fortune’s
fickle assurance, yelded, and acknowledged Philene for hys kinswoman.
And so Philene put in possession of the halfe of those goods, whereof
she was altogether out of hope, was well satisfied, and had the Romane
for hir father, Elisa for hir sister, and hir husband for hir kinsman.
That valyant
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page278" id = "page278">278</a></span>
Roman was so careful ouer Philene, as if she had ben his owne daughter,
and so indeuored, as he brought to passe that she obteined hir beloued
Scicilian to husbande: who also sent for hym to Carthage, where he
continued with his wife in the Romane’s house, and loved them both so
dearely as though he had ben father to the one, and father in lawe to
the other. In this maner these two poore wenches attained their two
husbands, for hauing of whom, theyr onely care was for Ryches, and for
lacke thereof were dryuen to despayre: and in the ende both (though
diuersly, and the one more fortunat than the other) recouered riches,
and with the same theyr husbandes, to their heartes singular ioye and
contentation. Which lucke I wyshe to all other poore Girles (but not
hangyng rype, or louynge in despayre) that bend their mindes on Mariage,
and seeke to people by that estate, their countrey common wealth. But
leauinge for a time these Tragicall Nouels and heauy chaunces, wee
purpose to remember some morall matters right worthy of remembraunce:
Letters they bee from a godly Pagane clerk, the famous Philosopher
Plutarch, Schoolemaister to an Emperour of no lesse vertue, than hys
mayster’s Schoole and mynde was fraught with diuine Precepts. Wherefore
proceede (good Reader) to continue the paynes vpon the readinge of
these, so well as thou hast vouchsafed to employ thy time before. They
shal no lesse delite thee, if vertue brooke thee, they shal no lesse
content thee if duty please thee, than any delightsome thing, whereupon
(at&nbsp;any tyme) thou hast employed thy vacaunte tyme.</p>

THE TWELFTH NOUELLE.</a></h3>

<h5>LETTERS OF THE EMPEROUR TRAIANE.</h5>

<p class = "summary">
Letters of the Philosopher Plutarch to the noble and vertuous Emperour
Traiane, and from the sayd Emperour to Plutarch: the lyke also from the
sayd Emperour to the Senate of Rome. In all which be conteyned godly
rules for gouernment of Princes, obedience of Subiects, and their duties
to common wealth.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">Bicause</span> these Letters ensuinge
(proceeding from the infallible Schoole of Wisedome, and practised by an
apt Scholler of the same, by a noble Emperor that was well trained vp by
a famous Philosopher) in myne opinion deserue a place of Recorde amonge
our Englishe Volumes, and for the wholsome errudition, ought to
Englishmen in english shape to bee described, I&nbsp;haue thought good
in this place to introduce the same. And although to some it shal not
peraduenture seeme fit and conuenient to mingle holy with prophane,
(accordinge to the prouerbe) to intermedle amongs pleasaunt histories,
ernest epistles, amid amorous Nouels, learned Letters, yet not to care
for report or thought of sutch findefaults, I&nbsp;iudge them not
vnseemely, the course of those histories. For amid the diuine works of
Philosophers and Oratours, amongs the pleasaunt paynes of auncient
Poets, and the Nouell writers of our time, merry verses so well as
morall matters be mingled, wanton bankets so wel as wise disputations
celebrated, tauntinge and iocund Orations so well as effectuall
declamations and persuasions pronounced. These letters contayne many
graue and wholesom documents, sundry vertuous and chosen Institutions
for Prynces and Noble men, yea and for sutch as beare offyce and
preferment in commonwealth from highest title to meanest degree. Theese
letters do vouch the reioyce of a Schoolemayster for bringinge vp a
Scholler of capacity and aptnesse, to imbrace and Fix in Memory sutch
lessons as he taught him. These Letters do gratulate and remembre the
ioy of the disciple for hauinge sutch a maister. These letters do
pronounce the minde of a vertuous Prince towardes
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page280" id = "page280">280</a></span>
hys subiects for choyse of him to the empire, and for that they had
respect rather to the vertue and condition, than to the nobility or
other extreme accident. To be short, these letters speake and pronounce
the very humblenesse and fealty that ought to rest in subiectes’ hearts:
with a thousand other excellent sentences of duties. So that if the
Emperour Nerua had bin aliue agayne to peruse these letters and Epistles
of congratulation betweene the Schoolemayster and Scholler, he would no
lesse haue reioysed in Plutarch than king Philip of Macedon did of
Aristotle, when hee affirmed himself to be happy, not so much for
hauinge sutch a sonne as Alexander was, as for that he was borne in
sutch a time, as had brought Aristotle to be his maister. That good
Emperor Nerua, shewed a patern to his successor by his good vertuous
lyfe and godly gouernment, which made a successor and a people of no
lesse consequence than they were trayned, accordingly as Herodian
voucheth, that for the most part the people be wont to imitate the Life
of their Prince and soueraygne Lord. If Philip deemed hymselfe happy and
blessed for hauing sutch a sonne and mayster, then might Nerua terme
himselfe threefolde more happy for sutch a Nephew and sutch a notable
Schoolemayster as Plutarch was, who not only by doctrine but by practise
proued a passing good Scholler. Alexander was a good Scholer and for the
time wel practised his maister’s Lessons, but afterwards as glory and
good hap accompanied his noble disposition, so did he degenerate from
former life, and had quite forgotten what he had learned, as the second
Nouell of this Booke more at large declareth. But Traiane of a toward
Scholler, proued sutch an Emperour and victor ouer himselfe, as
schoolinge and rulinge were in him miraculous, and surmounting Paragon
of piety and vertue: wherefore not to stay thee from the perusinge of
those Letters, the right image of himselfe: thus beginneth Plutarch to
write vnto his famous Scholler Traiane.</p>

A Letter of the Philosopher Plutarch to the Emperor Traiane, wherein is

<p><span class = "firstword">My</span> most dread soueraygne Lorde,
albeit of longe tyme I haue known the modesty of your mynde, yet neyther
I nor other liuing man did euer know that you aspired to that, which
many men desire, which is to be Emperour of Rome. That man should
withdrawe himselfe from honour, it were cleane without the boundes of
wysedome: but not to lycence the heart to desire the same, that truely
is a worke diuine, and not proceedinge of humayne nature. For he doeth
indifferently well, that represseth the works which his handes be able
to do, without staying upon his owne desires, and for good consideration
wee may terme thine Empire to be very happy, sith thou hast so nobly
demeaned thy selfe to deserue the same without search and seekinge
industrious pollicy to attayne thereunto. I&nbsp;haue known within the
city of Rome many great personages, which were not so mutch honored for
the offices whych they bare, as they were for the meanes and deuises
whereby they sought to be aduaunced to the same. May it please you to
vnderstand (most excellent Prince) that the honor of a vertuous man doth
not consist in the office, which he presently hath, but rather in the
merites that preferred him thereunto: In such wise, as it is the office
that honoreth the partye, and to the officer there resteth but a painful
charge. By meanes wherof, when I remember that I was your gouerner from
your youth, and instructed your vertuous mind in letters, I&nbsp;can not
chose but very much reioyce, so well for your soueraigne vertue, as for
your maiestie’s good fortune, deming it to be a great happinesse vnto me
that in my time Rome hath inioyed him to be their souraigne lord, whom I
had in tymes past to be my scholler. The principalities of kyngdomes
some winne by force, and maintayne them by armes, which ought not so to
be in you, nor yet conceiue opinion of your selfe, but rather to thinke
that the empire which you gounerne by vniuersall consent, yee ought to
entertayne and rule with general iustice. And therfore if you loue and
reuerence the Gods, if you
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page282" id = "page282">282</a></span>
bee pacient in trauels, warie in daungers, curteous to your people,
gentle to straungers, and not couetous of treasure, nor louer of your
owne desires: you shall make your fame immortall, and gouern the common
wealth in soueraign peace: that you be not a louer of your own desires,
I&nbsp;speake it not withoute cause, for there is no worse gouernement
than that which is ruled by selfe wyll and priuate opinion. For as he
that gouerneth a common wealth ought to lyue in feare of al men, euen so
mutch more in feare of him selfe, in so mutch as he may commit greater
errour by doinge that which his owne luste commaundeth, than if he were
ruled by the counsell of other. Assure you sir, that you can not hurt
your selfe, and mutch lesse preiudice vs your subiects, if you do
correct your selfe before you chastise others, esteemyng that to bee a
ryght good gouernment when you be prodigal in workes, and spare of
speache. Assay then to be such a one now, that you do commaunde, as you
were when you were commaunded. For otherwise it would lyttle auaile to
do things for deseruing of the empyre, if afterwards your dedes be
contrary to former deserts. To com to honour it is a humane worke, but
to conserue honour it is a thing diuine. Take hede then (most excellent
Traiane) that you do remembre and still reuolue in minde, that as you be
a Prince supreme, so to apply your self to be a passing ruler. For there
is no authority amongs men so high, but that the Gods aboue be iudges of
their thoughts, and men beneth beholders of their deedes. Wherfore sith
presentlye you are a mighty Prince, your duety is the greater to be
good, and leisure lesse to be wycked, than when you were a pryuate Man.
For hauing gotten authority to commaund, your lyberty is the lesse to
bee idle: so that if you bee not sutch a one as the common people haue
opinion of you, and such againe as your maister Plutarch desireth, you
shall put your selfe in greate Daunger, and myne Ennymyes wyll seeke
meanes to bee reuenged on mee, knowynge wel that for the Scholler’s
faulte the Mayster Dayly suffreth wronge by slaunderous checke imputed
vnto hym (although withoute cause.) And for so much as I haue ben thy
maister, and thou my scholer, thou must indeuour by well doyng, to
render me some honour. And lykewyse if thou do euyll, great infamy shall
lyght on me, euen as
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page283" id = "page283">283</a></span>
it did to Seneca for Nero his cause, whose cruelties don in Rome were
imputed to his mayster Seneca. The like wronge was done to the
Philosopher Chilo, by beyng burdened with the neglygent nouriture of his
Scholler Leander. They truely were famous personages and greate learned
men, in whom the gouernemente of myghty Princes was reposed:
notwithstandyng, for not correcting them in their youth, nor teachying
them with carefull dylygence, they blotted for euermore theyr renoume,
as the cause of the destruction of many common wealthes. And forsomuch
as my pen spared none in times paste, bee well assured Traiane, that the
same will pardon neither thee or mee in tyme to come: for as wee bee
confederate in the fault, euen so we shal be heires of the pain. Thou
knowest well what lessons I haue taught thee in thy youth, what counsell
I haue gyuen thee, beeying come to the state of man, and what I haue
written to thee, sithens thou hast ben Prince, and thou thy selfe art
recorde of the wordes which I haue spoken to thee in secrete: in all
whych I neuer persuaded thyng but that intended to the seruice of the
gods, profite of the common wealthe and increase of thy renoume:
wherfore, I&nbsp;am right sure, that for anye thing which I haue
written, sayd, or persuaded there is no cause I should feare the
punishment of the gods, and much lesse the reprochful shame of men,
verily beleuing that al which I coulde say in secrete, might without
reproch be openly published in Rome. Nowe before I toke my pen in hand
to write this Letter, I&nbsp;examined my lyfe, to know, if (during the
time that I had charge of thee) I&nbsp;dyd or sayd in thy presence any
thing that might prouoke thee to euill example. And truely (vnmete for
me to say&nbsp;it) vpon that searche of my forepassed life, I&nbsp;neuer
found my selfe guilty of facte vnmeete a Roman Cytyzen, nor euer spoke
woorde vnseemelye for a Phylosoper: by meanes whereof I doe ryght
heartely wyshe, thou wouldest remember the good educatyon and
instructyon whych thou dyddest learne of mee. I&nbsp;speake not thys,
that thou shouldest gratifie me againe with any Benefite, but to the
ende thou myghtest serue thy selfe, esteemynge that no greater pleasure
there is that can redounde to me, than to heare a good report of thee.
Be then well assured that if an Empyre bee bestowed vpon thee, it was
not for that thou wer a Citizen of
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page284" id = "page284">284</a></span>
Rome or a couragious person descended of noble house, rich and mighty,
but only bicause vertues did plentifully abounde in thee.
I&nbsp;dedicated vnto thee certaine bookes of old and auncient common
wealth, which if it please thee to vse, and as at other times I haue
sayd vnto thee, thou shalte finde mee to be a proclaimer of thy famous
workes, and a chronicler of all thy noble facts of armes: but if
perchaunce thou follow thine owne aduise, and chaunge thy selfe to bee
other than hitherto thou hast ben, presently I inuocate and cry out vpon
the immortall Gods, and this Letter shall be wytnesse, that if any hurt
do chaunce to thee, or to thine Empire, it is not through the counsell
or meanes of thy maister Plutarch. And so farewell most Noble
Prynce.</p>

The aunswere of the Emperour Traiane to hys mayster Plutarch.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">Cocceius</span> Traiane Emperour of Rome,
to the Philosopher Plutarch, sometimes my mayster: salutation and
consolation in the Gods of comfort. In Agrippina was deliuered vnto me a
letter from thee, whych so soone as I opened, I&nbsp;knew to be written
wyth thine owne hand, and endited with thy wysedom. So flowing was the
same with goodly woordes and accompanied with graue sentences, an
occasion that made mee reade the same twice or thrice, thinking that I
saw thee write and heard thee speak, and so welcome was the same to me,
as at that very instant I caused it to be red at my table, yea and made
the same to be fixed at my bed’s heade, that thy well meanyng vnto me
might be generally knowen, how mutch I am bound vnto thee.
I&nbsp;esteemed for a good presage the congratulation that the Consul
Rutulus did vnto me from thee, touchinge my commyng to the empire:
I&nbsp;hope through thy merites, that I shall be a good Emperoure. Thou
sayest in thy letter, that thou canste by no meanes beleue that I haue
giuen bribes, and vsed meanes to buye myne Empire, as other haue done.
For aunswere thereunto I say, that as a man I haue desired it, but neuer
by solicitation or other meanes attempted it: for I neuer saw wythin the
City of Rome any man to bribe for honour, but for the same, some notable
infamy chaunced vnto hym, as for
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page285" id = "page285">285</a></span>
example wee may learne of the Good old man Menander, my friende and thy
neyghbour, who to be Consul, procured the same by vnlawful meanes, and
therfore in the end was banished and died desperately. The greate Caius
Cæsar, and Tiberius, Caligula, Cladius, Nero, Galba, Otho Vitelius, and
Domitian, some for usurpyng the Empire, some for tyranny, some for
gettyng it by bribes, and some by other meanes procuryng the same, lost
(by&nbsp;the sufferance of the righteous gods) not onely their honour
and goodes, but also they died miserably. When thou dydst reade in thy
schole, and I that time an hearer of thy doctrine, many times I hearde
thee say, that we ought to trauel to deserue honour, rather than procure
the same, esteemynge it vnlawfull to get honour by meanes vnlawfull. He
that is without credite, ought to assay to procure credite. Hee that is
with out honour, ought to seeke honour. But the vertuous man hathe no
neede of noblenesse, ne hee himselfe, ne yet any other person can
berieue him of due honour. Thou knowest wel Plutarch, that the yere
past, the office of Consul was gyuen to Torquatus, and the Dictatorship
to Fabritius, who were so vertuous and so little ambitious as not
desyrous to receyue such charges, absented themselues, although that in
Rome, they might have ben in great estimation, by reason of those
offices, and yet neuerthelesse without them they bee presently esteemed,
loued and honoured: and therefore I conceiue greater delight in Quintius
Lincinatus, in Scipio Affricanus, and good Marcus Portius, for
contemning of theyr offices, than for the victories which they
atchieued: for victories many times consist in fortune, and the not
caryng for honorable charge in onely wisedome. Semblably, thou thy selfe
art witnesse, that when myn vncle Cocceius Nerua was exiled to Capua, he
was more visited, and better serued, than when he was at Rome: whereby
may bee inferred, that a vertuous man may bee exyled or banished, but
honour he shall neuer want. The Emperour Domitian (if&nbsp;you do
remember) at the departure of Nerua, made me many offers, and thee many
fayre promises to entertain thee in his house, and to send mee into
Almayne, which thou couldest not abyde, and much lesse consent, deeming
it to be greater honour with Nerua to be exiled, than of Domitian to be
fauored. I&nbsp;sweare by
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page286" id = "page286">286</a></span>
the Gods immortall, that when the good olde man Nerua sent me the
ensigne of the Empyre, I&nbsp;was vtterly ignorant thereof, and voyd of
hope to atteyne the same: for I was aduertised from the Senate, that
Fuluius sued for it, and that Pamphilius went about to buy it.
I&nbsp;knew also that the Consul Dolobella attempted to enioy it: then
sith the gods did permit, that I should be Emperour, and that myne vncle
Nerua did commaund the same, the Senate approued it, and the common
wealth would haue it to be so: and sith it was the generall consent of
all men, and specially your aduyse, I&nbsp;haue greate hope that the
Gods will be fauorable vnto me, and Fortune no ennimie at all: assuring
you, that like ioy whych you do saye you had by teachyng me, and seing
me now to be Emperour, the lyke I haue to thynke that I was your
Scholler: and sith that you wyll not call mee from henceforth any other
but Soueraygne Lord, I&nbsp;wyll terme you by none other name, than
Louyng father. And albeit that I haue ben visited and counselled by many
men since my commyng to the Empyre, and by thee aboue the rest, whom
before all other I wyll beleue, consideryng that the intent of those
which counsell me, is to draw my mynd to theyrs, your letters purportyng
nothyng else but mine aduauntage. I&nbsp;doe remember amongs other
woordes, which once you spake to Maxentius the Secretary of Domitian,
this saying: that they which doe presume to gyue counsell vnto Prynces,
oughte to bee free from all passions and affections: for in counsell,
where the wyll is moste enclined, the mynde is more prompte and ready:
that a Prince in all thyngs doe his wyll I prayse not: that he take
aduise and counsell of euery man I lesse allowe. That which he ought to
doe (as&nbsp;me thinke) is to doe by counsel, forseeing for al that to
what counsel he applieth his mynd: for counsel ought not to be taken of
hym whom I doe well loue, but of hym of whom I am well beloued. All this
I have wrytten (my&nbsp;mayster Plutarch) to aduertise you that from
henceforthe I desire nothyng else at your handes, but to be holpen wyth
your aduise in myne affayres, and that you tell me of my committed
faults: for if Rome do thinke me to be a defender of their common wealth
I make accompte of you to bee an ouerseer of my life: and therefore if
you thinke that I am not thankfull ynough for the good aduyse, and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page287" id = "page287">287</a></span>
holsom warenings that you gyue me: I&nbsp;am to intreate you (myne owne
good mayster) not to take it in ill part, for in such cases, the griefe
that I conceiue, is not for the good lessons you gyue me, but for the
shame that I fayle in followyng them. The bryngyng of me vp in thy
house, the hearyng of thy lectures, the folowyng of thy doctryne, and
liuing vnder thy disciplyne, haue ben truly the pryncipal causes that I
am commen to this Empyre. This mutch I say (mayster) for that it were an
vnnatural parte in thee not to assist me to beare that thing, which thou
haste holpen me to gayne and winne: and although that Vespasian was of
nature a very good man, yet his greatest profite redounded to him by
entertayning of the Philosopher Appolonius. For truelye it is a greater
felicity for a Prince to chaunce vpon a good and faythfull man, to be
neare about him, than to atchieue a large realme and kingdome. Thou
sayest (Plutarch) that thou shalt receiue great contentation, from
henceforth, if I be such a one now as I was before, or at lestwise if I
be no worse. I&nbsp;belieue that which thou doest say, bicause the
Emperour Nero, was the first fiue yeares of hys empyre good, and the
other nine yeares exceedyng euill, in sutch wyse as he grew to be
greater in wickednesse, than in dygnity. Notwithstanding, if thou thinke
that as it chaunced vnto Nero, so may happen vnto Traiane, I&nbsp;besech
the immortall Gods rather to depriue me of life, than to suffer me to
raigne in Rome: for tyrantes bee they, whych procure dygnytyes and
promotyons, to vse them for delighte and filthye luste: and good Rulers
bee they which seeke them for profite of Common wealthe: and therfore to
them whych before they came to those degrees were good, and afterwardes
waxed Wycked, greater pity than enuye ought to be attributed,
consideryng specyally, that Fortune did not aduaunce them to honour, but
to shame and villany: beleue me then (good maister) that sith hitherto I
haue ben reputed vertuous, I&nbsp;wyl assay by God’s assistance to
aspire to be better, rather than to be worsse. And so the Gods preserue
thee.</p>

The Letter of the Emperour Traiane to the Senate of Rome, wherein is
conteined, that honour ought rather to be deserued than procured.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">Cocceius</span> Traiane Emperour of the
Romanes, euer Augustus, to our sacred Senate health and consolation in
the gods of comfort. We beinge aduertised here at Agrippina of the
Deathe of the Emperour Nerua, your soueraigne Lord and my predecessour,
and knowing it to be true, that you haue wept and bewailed the losse of
a Prince so noble and ryghteous, we likewise haue felt like sorow, for
the death of so notable a father. When children lose a good father, and
subiects a good Prynce, eyther they muste dye wyth them, or else by
teares they must rayse them vp again, for so much as a good Prince in a
common wealth is so rare, as the Phœnix in Arabia. My lord Nerua
broughte me out of Spayne to Rome, nourished me vp in youth, caused mee
to bee trained in letters and adopted me for his sonne in mine olde age:
which graces and benefits truly I can not forget, knowyng that the
ingrate man prouoketh the Gods to anger, and men to hatred. The death of
a vertuous man is to be lamented of all men, but the death of a good
Prince, ought to be extremely mourned: for if a common person die, there
is but one dead, but if a god Prynce die, together with him dieth a
whole Realme. I&nbsp;speake this (O&nbsp;ye Fathers) for the rare
vertues abounding in myne vncle Nerua: for if the gods were disposed to
sell vs the liues of good Prynces already departed, it were but a small
ransome to redeeme them with teares: for what gold or syluer may be
sufficient to buie the lyfe of a vertuous man. Truely there woulde be a
greate masse of money gyuen by the Greekes for Alexander, by the
Lacedemonians for Lycurgus, by the Romanes for Augustus, and by the
Carthaginians for Annibal. But as you knewe the gods hauing made all
thynges mortall, so haue they reserued onely themselues to bee
immortall. How eminent and passing the vertue of the good is, and what
priuiledge the godly haue, it may easily bee knowne: for so mutch, as
honour is carried euen to the very graues of the dead, but so it is not
to the greate Palaces of the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page289" id = "page289">289</a></span>
wycked. The good and vertuous man, without sighte or knowledge we loue,
serue, and aunswer for him: wherein the wycked we cannot beleue what he
sayeth, and lesse accepte in good part the thyng whych he doeth for vs.
Touchynge the electyon of the Empyre, it was done by Nerua, it was
demaunded by the people, approued by you, and accepted by me. Wherefore
I prayt the immortall Goddes that it may bee lyked of theyr godheades:
for to small purpose auayleth the election of Prynces, if the gods doe
not confyrme it: and therefore a man maye knowe hym whych is chosen by
the Gods, from him that is elected by men, for the one shal declyne and
fal, the other shalbe vpholden and preserued: the choyse of man so
vaynely exalted doth bowe and abase, but that which is planted by the
gods, although it bee tossed to and fro wyth seuerall Wynds, and
receiueth greate aduersitye, and boweth a lyttle, yet the same shall
neuer fal. Ye know right wel (most honorable Fathers) that I neuer
demaunded the Empyre of Nerua my Soueraigne Lorde, although he broughte
me vp and was his Nephew, hauing heard and wel remembring of my Mayster
Plutarch, that honour ought rather to bee deserued than procured.
Notwithstanding I wyll not deny but ioyfull I was when my Lord Nerua
sent me the ensigne of that greate and hygh dignity: and yet I wyll
confesse that hauing begon to tast the trauailes and cares which that
imperiall state bringeth, I&nbsp;did repent more then a Thousand times
for taking vppon mee a charge so great: for Empire and gouernement is of
sutch quality that although the honor be mighty, yet the gouernour
sustaineth manifold paines and miserable trauailes. O&nbsp;how greatly
doth he bind himself, which by gouernment bindeth other! for if hee bee
iuste they call hym cruell, if hee bee Pitifull, he is contempned, if
liberall, he is esteemed Prodigall, if he keepe or gather together he is
counted couetous, if hee be peaceable and quiet, they deeme him for a
coward, if he be couragious, he is reputed a quareller, if graue, they
will say he is proude, if he be easie to be spoken to, hee is thought to
be light or simple, if solitary, they will esteeme him to be an
hypocrite, and if he be ioyfull, they will terme hym dissolute: In sutch
wise as they wil be contented, and vse better termes to al others what
so euer, than towardes him, which gouerneth
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page290" id = "page290">290</a></span>
a common wealth: for to sutch a one they recken the morsels which he
eateth, they measure his pases, they note his words, they take heede to
his companies, and iudge of his works (many times wrongfully,) they
examine and murmure of his pastimes, and attempt to Coniecture hys
Thoughtes: consider then the trauayles which bee in gouernement, and the
enuy which many times they beare vnto him that ruleth. We may say, that
there is no state more sure than that which is furthest of from Enuy.
And if a man cannot but wyth great payne gouerne the wyfe which hee hath
chosen, the children which he hath begotten, nor the seruaunt which he
hath brought vp, hauing them altogether in one house: how is it possible
that he can still conserue in peace a whole commonwealth? I&nbsp;praye
you tell mee, in whom shall a poore Prince repose his trust, syth that
many times hee is most slaundered by theym whom he fauoureth best?
Prynces and great Lordes cannot eate without a Garde, cannot sleepe
without a watch, cannot speake without espiall, nor walke without some
saufety, in sutch wise as they being Lords of al, they be as it were,
Prisoners of their owne people. And if we wil beholde somewhat neerely,
and consider the seruitude of Princes, and the liberty of Subiectes, we
shall finde that he which hath most to doe in the Realme, or beareth
greatest swinge, is most subiect to Thraldome. So that if Princes haue
authority to geue liberty, they haue no meanes to be free themselues:
the gods haue created vs so fre, and euery man desireth to haue hys
liberty so mutch at wyll, that a man be he neuer so familiar a freende,
or so neare of kin, we rather haue him to be our subiect, than our Lorde
and mayster: one man alone commandeth all, and yet it seemeth to him but
little: ought we then to marueile, if many be weary to obey one? Wee
loue and esteeme our selues so mutch, as I neuer saw any which of his
owne good wil would be subiect, ne yet agaynst his will was made a Lord,
a&nbsp;Principle by dayly experience proued very true: for the quarrels
and warres that be amongs men, are not so mutch for obedience sake, as
for rule and commaundment. I&nbsp;say moreouer, that in drinking,
eating, clothing, speaking, and louing, al men be of diuers qualities:
but to get lyberty, they be all conformable. I&nbsp;haue spoken thus
mutch (O&nbsp;Fathers conscript) vpon

occasion of mine owne Empire, which I haue taken with good will, albeit
afterwards I was sory for the great charge. For the waltering Seas and
troublesome gournement be two things agreeable to beholde, and
daungerous to proue. Notwithstanding sith it hath pleased the Gods that
I should be youre Lord, and you my subiects, I&nbsp;beseech you hartely
to vse your obedience, as to your soueraygne lord, in that which shall
be right and iust, and to aduertise me like a father, in things that
shall seeme vnreasonable. The Consul Rutulus hath sayed mutch vnto mee
in your behalfe, and hath saluted me for the people, hee himselfe shall
bring aunswere and shal salute you al in my name. The Allobrogians and
the inhabitaunts about the riuer Rhene, be at controuersie for the
limittes of their countrey, and haue prayed me to be their Arbitrator,
which will stay me a little there. I&nbsp;require that this letter may
be red within the Senate house, and manifested to the whole people. The

An other Letter of the Emperour Traian to the Romayne Senate, contayning
how gouerners of Common wealths ought to bee friendes rather to those
whych vse traficke, than to them that gather and heape together.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">Cocceius Traiane</span> Emperour of the
Romaynes to our holy senate health and consolation in the Gods of
comfort. The affayres be so manyfolde, and businesse so graue and
weighty, which we haue to doe with diuers Countries, that scarce we haue
tyme to eate, and space to take anye rest, the Romane Prynces hauing
still by auncient custome both lacke of tyme, and commonly want of
money. And bicause that they which haue charge of common wealths, to the
vttermost of their power ought to be fryends to traficke of marchandise,
and enimyes of heapynge treasure together, Prynces haue so many people
to please, and so greate numbre of crauers, that if they keepe any thing
for them, the same shall rather seeme a spice of theft than of
prouidence. To take away an other man’s goodes, truly is a wycked part:
but if it bee permitted
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page292" id = "page292">292</a></span>
to take Treasure, better it were to take it out of the Temples, than to
defraude the people: for the one is consecrated to the immortall Gods,
and the other to the pore commons. I&nbsp;speake this (right honorable
fathers) to put you in remembraunce, and also to aduise you, that you
take good heede to the goodes of the common wealth, howe they bee
dyspended, howe gathered together, howe they bee kepte, and howe they be
employed. For ye ought to vnderstand, that the goodes of the Common
wealth be committed to you in trust, not to the ende yee shoulde enioy
them, but rather by good gouernement to vse them. We do heare that the
Walles be ready to fal, the Towers be in decay, and the Temples in great
ruine, wherof we be not a lyttle offended, and you ought also to be
ashamed, for so mutch as the damages and detryments of the Common
wealth, we ought eyther to remedy, or else to lament. Ye haue wrytten
vnto mee to know my pleasure, whether the censors, pretors, and ediles
should be yearely chosen, and not perpetuall, as hitherto they haue
bene: and specyally you say, that the state of the Dictators (which is
the greatest and highest dignity in Rome) is onely but for sixe moneths.
To that I aunswer, that we are wel contented wyth that aduyse: for not
wythout cause and iust reason our predecessours dyd abolyshe the fyrst
kynges of Rome, and ordayned, that the Consuls should yearely be chosen
in the Common wealthe. Whych was done, in consyderation that hee whych
had perpetuall gouernement, many tymes became insolente and proude. And
therefore that the charges and offices of the Senate, should be yearely,
to auoyde danger, which if they should be perpetual there myght ensue
great hurt and damage to the common wealth: for if the Officers beyng
yerely chosen, be good, they may be continued: and if they bee euyll,
they may be chaunged. And truely the officer, whych knoweth that vpon
the end of euery yeare he must be chaunged and examined of his charge,
he wyll take good heede to that whych he speaketh, and first of all wil
consider what he taketh in hand. The good Marcus Portius was the first
that caused the Officers of the Romane Common Wealthe to bee thus
visited and corrected. And bycause that these Almayne Warres doe styll
increase, by reason that kyng Deceball wyll not as yet bee brought to
obedience of the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page293" id = "page293">293</a></span>
Romanes, but rather goeth about to occupy and winne the Kingdomes of
Dacia and Polonia, I&nbsp;shall be forced through the businesse of the
wars, (so&nbsp;long continuing) to deuyse and consult here vppon the
affayres touchyng the gouernement of the common wealth of Rome. For a
lesse euyll it is for a Prynce to be neglygent in matters of Warre, than
in the gouernement of the Common Wealth. A&nbsp;Prynce also ought to
think, that he is chosen, not to make wars, but to gouerne, not to kyll
the Enimies, but to roote out vices, not that he goe in person to inuade
or defend his foes, but that he reside and be in the Common Wealth, and
not to take away other men’s goodes, but to do iustice in euery man, for
so mutch as the Prynce in the warres can fight but for one, and in the
publyke wealth he committeth faults against a numbre. Truly it liketh me
wel, that from the degree of captaines men be aduaunced to bee emperors,
but I think it not good, that emperours do descende to be captains,
considering that, that realm shal neuer be in quyet, where the Prince is
to gret a warrior. This haue I spoken (fathers conscript) to the intent
ye may beleue, that I for my parte if these warres of Almayne were to
begin, I&nbsp;being at Rome, it wer impossible that I should be brought
vnto the same, for that my principal intent, is to be estemed rather a
good gouerner of a common wealth, than a forward captain in the field:
nowe then principally I commend vnto you the veneration of the temples,
and honor of the gods, bicause kings neuer liue in surety, if the gods
be not honored, and the temples serued. The last words which my good
lord Nerua wrot vnto me were these: “Honour the Temples, feare the gods,
maintein Iustice in thy commonwealth and defend the pore: in so doing
thou shalt not be forgotten of thy friend, nor vanquished by thy foe.”
I&nbsp;do greatly recommend vnto you the vertues of amity and
fraternity, for that you know how in great common wealthes, more hurt
and damage do ciuile and neighborly wars bryng vnto the same, than those
attempted by the enimies. If parents against parents, and neighbours
against neighbours had not begon mutuall hatred and contention, neuer
had Demetrius ouerthrowen the Rhodes, neuer had Alexander conquered
Thyr, Marcellus Syracusa, Scipio Numantia. I&nbsp;recommend vnto you
also the poore people, loue the orphanes
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page294" id = "page294">294</a></span>
and fatherlesse children, support and help the widowes, beware of
quarrels and debates amongs you, and the causes of the helplesse se that
ye maintaine and defende: bicause the Gods dyd neuer wreake more cruell
vengeance vpon any, than vpon those which dyd ill intreate and vse the
poore and neady: and many times I haue heard my Lord Nerua say, that the
gods neuer shewed themselues so rygorous, as agaynst a mercilesse and
vnpitifull people. Semblably, we pray you to be modest of woords,
pacient to suffer, and ware in your forme of lyfe. For a great fault it
is, and no lesse shame to a Gouerner, that he prayse the people of his
common wealth, and gyue them occasion to speake euill of him: and
therefore they which haue charge of the common wealth, ought rather to
repose trust in their workes, than in theyr woords, for so mutch as the
Citizens or common people, do rather fixe theyr iudgement vpon that
which they see, than on that which they heare. I&nbsp;would wysh that
(touching the affayres appertinent to the Senate) they might not know in
you any sparke of ambicion, malice, deceipte, or enuy, to the intent
that the iust men might not so mutch complain of the commaunding of the
common wealth, as vpon the entertainment and profite of the same. The
Empire of the Greeks putting theyr felicity in eloquence, and we in well
doing. I&nbsp;speake this (ryght honorable Fathers) to Counsell and
Exhorte ye, that when ye be assembled in Senate, ye do not consume tyme
in dysputing and holding opinions for the verification of any thynge.
For if you will iudge wythout parciality and affection without great
disputation, ye may come to reason. I&nbsp;do remember that being at a
lesson of Appolonius Thianeus, I&nbsp;heard him say that it was not so
expedient that Senators and Emperors should be skilful and wyse, as if
they suffred themselues to bee gouerned by those that were of great
experience and knowledg: and verely he said truth: for by that meanes he
prohibited and forbad them, not to arrest and stand vpon their owne
opinion, whereof they ought to be many times suspicious. Lykewyse we
recommend vnto you the censores, who haue charge of Iudgement, and the
Tribunes, whose office is to attende the affrayes of Common Wealthe,
that they bee wyse and learned in the Lawes, expert in the Customes,
prouident in Iudgementes, and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page295" id = "page295">295</a></span>
ware in theyr trade of lyfe: for I say vnto you, that a wyse man is more
availeable in gouernement of a common wealth, than a man of ouermutch
skyll and experyence. The forme then whych ye shal obserue in matters of
Iudgement shall be thus: that in ciuile processe you keepe the law, and
in criminall causes to moderate the same, bicause haynous, cruell, and
rigorous lawes be rather made to amaze and feare, than to be obserued
and kept. When you giue any sentence, ye ought to consider the age of
the offendaunt, when, how, wherefore, with whome, in whose presence, in
what time, and how longe ago, forsomutch as euery of these thyngs may
eyther excuse or condempne: whych you ought to beare and vse towards
them in lyke sort as the gods towards vs, who giue vs better helpe and
succoure and correct vs lesse than we deserue. That consideration the
Iudges ought to haue, bycause the offenders doe rather trespasse the
Gods than men: if then they be forgiuen of the gods for offences whych
they commit, reason it is that we pardon faultes don by those rather
then by our selues. In like maner we commaund you, that if your enimies
do you any anoiance or iniury, not incontinently to take reuenge, but
rather to dissemble the same, bicause many wrongs be don in the world,
which were better to be dissembled than reuenged. Wherin ye shal haue
like regard, touching offices in the Senate and Common Wealth, that they
be not giuen to ambicious or couetous persons: for there is no Beaste in
the World so pestiferous and Venomous, to the Common Wealth, as the
Ambicious in commaunding, and the couetous in gathering togither. Other
things we let passe for this tyme, vntil we haue intelligence howe these
our commaundements be fulfilled. This Letter shal be red in the chyefest
place within the Senate, and afterwards pronounced to the people, that
they may both know what yee commaunde, and see also what ye doe. The
Gods keepe you, whome we pray to preserue our mother the City of Rome,
and to send vs good successe in these our Warres.</p>

A notable Letter sent from the Romane Senate to the Emperour Traiane,
where in is declared how sometimes the region of Spayne did furnish Rome
wyth golde from their Mines, and now do adorne and garnish the same with
Emperours to gouerne their Common wealth.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> sacred Romane Senate, to thee
the great Cocceius Traiane new Emperour Augustus, health in thy gods and
ours, graces euerlastyng wee render to the immortall Gods, for that thou
art in health, which wee desyre and pray may be perpetual. We signified
vnto thy maiesty the death of Nerua Cocceius, our soueraigne Lord, and
thy predecessor, a&nbsp;man of sincere lyfe, a&nbsp;fryend of his Common
Wealth, and a zealous louer of Iustice, wherein also we aduertised, that
like as Rome did weepe for the cruell lyfe of Domitian, so mutch the
more bitterly doth she bewayle the death of thine vncle Nerua, whose
councel (although hee was very olde and diseased) which he gaue vs
lyinge on his Bedde, we loued better, and imbraced with greater
comforte, than all the enterpryses and deedes don by his predecessors,
when they were in health and lusty: and besides the ordinary mourning
vsed to bee done in Rome for Prynces, wee haue caused all recreation and
pastime to cease, so wel in the common wealth as with euery of vs
particularly. We haue shut vp the Temples and made the Senate
vnderstand, how displeasantly we accept the death of good men. The good
old gentleman Nerua dyed in hys house, and was buried in the fielde of
Mars: he died in debte, and we haue payd hys debtes: he dyed callyng
vppon the Gods, and we haue canonized him amongs theyr numbre, and that
which is most to be noted, hee died commending vnto vs the common
wealth, and the Common wealth recommending it self vnto him: and a
little before his latter gaspe, to the principall of the holy Senate,
and many other of the people, standing about his bedside, he sayde:
“O&nbsp;ye fathers, I&nbsp;committe vnto you the common wealth and my
selfe also vnto the Gods: vnto whom I render infinite thankes, bicause
they haue taken from me my children, to bee mine heires and haue lefte
mee Traiane to succede.” You do remembre (most
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page297" id = "page297">297</a></span>
dread soueraign lord) that the good Empereour Nerua had other
successours than your maiesty, of nearer alyance, of greater frendship
more bound by seruice, and of greater proofe in warfare: notwithstandyng
amongs other noble personages, vpon you alone he cast his eyes,
reposinge in you such opinyon and confidence, as to reuiue the prowes
and valyaunt facts of the good Emperor Augustus, he suppressed in
oblivion the insolent facts of Domitian. When Nerua came vnto the
Crowne, he found the treasure pilled, the Senate in dissentyon, the
people in commotion, Iustice not obserued, and the Common wealth
ouerthrowen: which you likewyse presentlye shall finde, although
otherwyse quiet and wholy reformed: wherfore we shalbe right glad, that
you conserue the Common wealth in the state wherin your vncle Nerua left
it, consideryng specially that new Prynces vnder colour to introduce new
customs, do ouerthrow their common Wealths: fourtene Prynces your
predecessours in the Empyre were naturally borne in Rome, and you are
the firste straunger Prynce. Wherefore we pray the immortall Gods, (sith
that the stocke of our auncient Cæsars is dead) to send thee good
Fortune. Out of the countrey of Spaine was wont to come to this our
Romane city great abundance of gold, siluer, steele, leade, and tinne,
from theyr mines: but now in place thereof, she giueth vs Emperours to
gouern our common wealths: sith then that thou commest of so good a
countrey as Spayne is, from so good a Prouince as is Vandolosia, and
from so excellent a citty as Cales is, of so noble and fortunate a
Linage as is Cocceius, and aduaunced to so noble an Empire, it is to be
supposed that thou wilt proue good and not euil: for the Gods immortall
many times do take away their graces from vngratefull men: moreouer
(most excellent prince) sith you wrote vnto vs the maner and order what
we ought to doe: reason it is that we write to you agayne what you ought
to foresee: and sith you haue tolde vs, and taught vs to obey you, meete
it is that we may know what your pleasure is to commaunde: for that
(it&nbsp;may come to passe) that as you haue bene brought vp in Spayne,
and of longe time bene absent from Rome, through followinge the Warres,
that not knowing the lawes whereunto we are sworn, and the customes
which we haue in Rome, yee commaunde some thinge
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page298" id = "page298">298</a></span>
that may redound to our damage, and to your dishonor: and therefore we
accoumpt it reason that your Maiesty bee aduertised hereof, and the same
preuented, for so much as Princes oftentimes be negligent of many
things, not for that they wil not foresee the same, but rather for want
of one that dare tell them what they ought to doe: and therefore we
humbly beseech your most excellent maiesty, to extende and shewe forth
your wisedome and prudence, for that the Romanes hearts bene drawen and
made pliant rather by fauourable diligence, than by prouoked force.
Touchinge the vertue, Iustice, may it please you to remembre the same:
for your olde vncle Nerua was wont to say, that a Prince for all his
magnanimity, valiaunce, and felicity, if he do not vse and maintayne
Iustice, ought not for any other merite to be praysed and commended.
Semblably we make our humble Petition, that those commaundements which
you shal send and require to be put in execution, be thoroughly
established and obserued: for the goodnesse of the lawe doth not consist
in the ordinaunce, but in the fulfilling and acomplishement of the same:
wee will not also omit to say vnto you (most famous Prince) that you
must haue pacience to suffer the importunate, and to dissemble with the
offenders: for that it is the deede of a Prince to chastise and punishe
the wrongs done in a common wealth, and to pardon the disobedience done
vnto him. You send vs word by your letters that you wil not come to
Rome, vntyll you haue finished the Germaine Warres: whych seemeth vnto
vs to be the determination of a vertuous and right noble Emperour, for
so mutch as good Princes such as you be, oughte not to desire and chose
places of delite and recreation, but rather to seke and win renowne and
fame. You commaunde vs also to haue regarde to the veneration of the
Temples, and to the seruice of the Gods: whych request is iuste, but
very iuste it were and meete that your selfe should doe the same: for
our seruice would little preuaile, if you should displease them. You wil
vs also one to loue an other, whych is the counsel of a holy and
peaceable Prince: but know ye that wee shal not be able to doe the same,
if you wil not loue and intreat vs all in equall and indifferent sorte:
for Prynces chearyshinge and louing some aboue the rest, do raise
slanders
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page299" id = "page299">299</a></span>
and grudges amongs the people: you likewise recommend vnto vs, the poore
and the widowes: wherin we thinke that you ought to commaund the
Collecters of your Tributes, that they do not grieue, when they gather
your ryghtes and customes: for greater sinne it is to spoyle and pill
the needy sort, than meritorious to succour and relieue them. Likewise
you do persuade vs to be quiet and circumspect in our affayres, which is
a persuasion resembling the nature of a worthye Prynce and also of a
pitifull father. In semblable maner you require vs not to be
opinionatiue and wilfull in the Senate, ne affectionate to self wil
whych shal be done accordingly as you commaund, and accept it as you
say: but therwithall you ought to think that in graue and wayghty
matters, the more depely things be debated, the better they shall be
prouided and decreed: you bid vs also to beware, the Censores be honest
of lyfe and rightful in doing iustice: to that we aunswere, that in the
same we will haue good respect, but it is expedient that you take hede
to them whom you shal name and appoint to those offices: for if you do
chose such as they ought to be, no cause shal rise to reprehend them.
Item wher you say, that we ought to take hede, that our children
committe no offences to the people, wherein the aduise of the senate is,
that you do draw them awaye from vs, and cal them to the Almayne warres,
for as you do knowe (right souerain prince) that when the publike welth
is exempt, and voyd of enimies, then the same wil begin to bee
replenyshed wyth youthfull vices. Notwithstanding when the warres bee
farre of from Rome, then the same to them is profitable, bicause there
is nothing which better cleanseth common wealths from wicked people,
than warres in straunge Countries. Concernyng other things which you
write vnto vs nedefull it is not now to recite them, but onely to see
them kept: for truely they seeme rather to be the lawes of God Apollo
him selfe, than counsels of a Mortall man. The gods preserue your
Maiesty, and graunt you good successe in those your warres.</p>

promotion, was not so swolne and puffed, but that it vouchsafed to cal
him father and maister, stil crauing for in instigation of reproofe,

A notable History of three amorous Gentlewomen, called Lamia, Flora, and
Lais: conteyning the sutes of noble Princes and other great Personages
made vnto them, with their answeres to diuers demaundes: and the manner
of their death and funerals.</p>


<p><span class = "firstword">Leauynge</span> now our morall discourse of
a carefull Mayster, of a prouydent Scholer, of a vertuous Emperoure, of
a sacred Senate, and vniforme magistery, returne we to the setting forth
and description of three arrant honest Women, which for lewdnesse wer
famous, and for wicked Lyfe worthy to be noted with a blacke coale, or
rather their memory raked in the Dust and Cinders of their Corpses
vnpure. But as all histories be ful of lessons of vertue and vice, as
Bookes, sacred and prophane, describe the liues of good and bad for
example sake, to yelde meanes to the posterity, to ensue the one and
eschue the other, so haue I thought to intermingle amongest these Nouels
the seuerall sortes of either, that ech Sexe and Kinde may pike out like
the Bee, of ech Floure, Honny, to store and furnishe with delightes
their well disposed myndes. I&nbsp;purpose, then, to vnlace the
dissolute lyues of three Amorouse Dames, that with their graces allured
the greatest Princes that euer were: enticed the noble men, and
sometimes procured the wisest and best learned to craue their
acquaintance, as by the sequele hereof shall well appeare. These three
famous Women, (as&nbsp;Writers do witnesse) were furnished with many
goodly graces and giftes of nature: that is to say, great beautye of
face, goodly proporcion of body, large and high foreheades, theyr
breastes placed in comely order, smal wasted, fayre handes of passing
cunning to play vpon Instruments, a&nbsp;heauenly voice to fayne and
sing: briefly, their qualities and beauty were more famous than euer any
that were born within the Countries of Asia and Europa. They were neuer
beloued of Prince that did forsake them, nor yet they made request of
any thing which was denied them: they neuer mocked or flowted man
(a&nbsp;thing rare in women of theyr condition) ne yet were mocked of
any: but theyr specyal propreties wer to allure men to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page302" id = "page302">302</a></span>
loue them: Lamia wyth hir pleasaunt loke and eye, Flora with hir
eloquent tongue, and Lais wyth the grace and sweetenesse of hir singing
voyce: a&nbsp;straunge thinge that he which once was surprysed wyth the
loue of any of those three, eyther to late or neuer was delyuered of the
same. They were the richest courtizans that euer lyued in the worlde, so
long as theyr life did last, and after theyr decease, great monumentes
were erected for theyr remembraunce, in place where they died. The most
auncient of these three Amorous dames was Lamia, who was in the tyme of
King Antigonus, that warfared in the seruice of Alexander the Great,
a&nbsp;valyant gentleman, although not fauored by Fortune. Thys kynge
Antigonus left behynde hym a sonne and heyre called Demetrius, who was
lesse valyaunt, but more fortunate than his father, and had bene a
Prynce of greate estimation, if in hys youthe hee had acquyred frendes,
and kept the same, and in hys age had not ben gyuen to so many vices.
Thys King Demetrius was in loue with Lamia, and presented hir wyth rich
giftes and rewardes, and loued hir so affectionately, and in sutch sort,
as in the loue of his Lamia he semed rather a fole than a true louer:
for, forgetting the grauity and authoritye of his person, hee dyd not
onelye gyue hir all such things as she demaunded, but besides that hee
vsed no more the company of his wyfe Euxonia. On a tyme Kyng Demetrius
asking Lamia what was the thing wherewyth a woman was sonest wonne?
“There is nothing,” answered shee, “whych sooner ouercommeth a Woman,
than when she seeth a man to loue hir with al hys hart, and to susteyne
for hir sake greate paynes and passyons wyth long continuance and entier
affection, for to love men by collusion, causeth afterwards that they be
mocked.” Agayn, Demetrius asked hir further: “Tell me, Lamia, why doe
diuerse Women rather hate than loue men?” Whereunto she answered: “The
greatest cause why a Woman doth hate a man, is, when the man doth vaunt
and boast himselfe of that which he doth not, and performeth not the
thing which he promiseth.” Demetrius demaunded of her: “Tell me, Lamia,
what is the thing wherewith men doe content you best?”&mdash;“When wee
see him,” sayde she, “to be dyscrete in wordes, and secrete in his
dedes.” Demetrius asked hir further: “Tell me, Lamia, how chaunceth it
that men
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page303" id = "page303">303</a></span>
be ill matched?” “Bycause,” answered Lamia, “it is impossible that they
be well maryed, when the wife is in neede, and the husbande vndiscrete.”
Demetrius asked hir what was the cause that amitye betwene <ins class =
"correction" title = "error for ‘two’">lwo</ins> louers was broken?
“There is nothing,” answered she, “that soner maketh colde the loue
betwene two louers, than when one of them doth straye in loue, and the
Woman louer to importunate to craue.” He demaunded further: “Tell me,
Lamia, what is the thinge that moste tormenteth the louing man?” “Not to
attayne the thing which he desireth,” answered she, “and thinketh to
lose the thing whych he hopeth to enioy.” Demetrius yet once agayne
asked hir thys question: “What is that, Lamia, which most troubleth a
Woman’s hart?” “There is nothing,” answered Lamia, “wherwith a woman is
more grieued, and maketh hir more sad, than to be called ill fauored, or
that she hath no good grace, or to vnderstand that she is dissolute of
lyfe.” This lady Lamia was of iudgement delicate and subtyll, although
il imployed in hir, and thereby made al the world in loue with hir, and
drew al men to hir through hir fayre speach. Now, before she lost the
heart of Kyng Demetrius, shee haunted of long time the vniuersities of
Athenes, where she gayned great store of money, and brought to
destructyon many young men. Plutarch, in the lyfe of Demetrius, saith,
That the Atheniens hauing presented vnto him <span class =
"smallroman">XII. C.</span> talents of
money for a subsidie to pay his men of warre, he gaue al that summe to
his woman Lamia: by meanes whereof the Atheniens grudged, and were
offended wyth the kyng, not for the losse of their gift, but for that it
was so euil employed. When the King Demetrius would assure any thynge by
oth, hee swore not by his gods, ne yet by his predecessors, but in this
sort: “As I may be styll in the grace of my lady Lamia, and as hir lyfe
and mine may ende together, so true is this which I say and do, in this
and thys sort.” One yere and two Moneths before the Death of King
Demetrius, his frend Lamia died, who sorowed so mutch hir death, as for
the absence and death of hir, he caused the Phylosophers of Athens to
entre in this Disputation, Whether the teares and sorow whiche he shed
and toke for her sake, were more to be estemed than the riches which he
spent in her obsequies and funerall pompes. This Amorous gentlewoman
Lamia, was borne
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page304" id = "page304">304</a></span>
in Argos, a&nbsp;City of Peloponnesus, besides Athenes, of base
parentage, who in hir first yeares haunted the countrey of Asia Maior,
of very wyld and dissolute lyfe, and in the ende came into Phænicia. And
when the Kyng Demetrius had caused hir to be buried beefore hys
chamber-window, hys chiefest frendes asked him, wherefore hee had
entoomed hir in that place? his aunswere was this: “I&nbsp;loued hir so
wel, and she likewyse me so hartyly, as I know not which way to satisfie
the loue which she bare me, and the duety I haue to loue her agayne, if
not to put hir in such place as myne eyes maye wepe euery day and mine
hart still lament.” Truely this loue was straung, which so mighty a
Monarch as Demetrius was, did beare vnto such a notable curtizan,
a&nbsp;woman vtterly void of grace, barren of good workes, and without
any zeale or spark of vertue, as it should appeare. But sith we read and
know that none are more giuen or bent to vnreasonable loue, than mighty
Princes, what should it bee demed straung and maruellous, if Demetrius
amongs the rest do come in place for the loue of that most famous woman,
if Fame may stretch to eyther sorts, both good and euill? But let vs
come to the second infamous gentlewoman, called Lais. She was of the
isle of Bithritos, which is in the confines of Græcia, and was the
daughter of the great Sacrificer of Apollo his temple at Delphos,
a&nbsp;man greatly experienced in the magike art, wherby he prophecyed
the perdition of his daughter. Now this amorous Lias was in triumph in
the time of the renowmed King Pyrrhus, a&nbsp;Prince very ambitious to
acquire honor, but not very happy to keepe it, who being yonge of
sixteene or seuenteene yeares, came into Italy to make warres against
the Romains: he was the first (as&nbsp;some say) that aranged a camp in
ordre, and made the Phalanx, the mayne square and battell: for before
hys time, when they came to entre battell, they assailed confusedly and
out of array gaue the onset. This amorous Lias continued long time in
the campe of Kynge Pyrrhus, and went wyth hym into Italy, and wyth him
retourned from warre agayne, and yet hir nature was sutch, as shee
woulde neuer bee mainteined wyth one man alone. The same Lias was so
amorous in her conuersatyon, so excellent fayre, and of so comely grace,
that if shee would haue kept hir selfe faythfull to one Lorde or
gentleman, there
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page305" id = "page305">305</a></span>
was no prynce in the world but if he would haue yelded himselfe and all
that he had at hir commaundement. Lias, from hir retourne out of Italy
into Greece, repayred to the citye of Corinth, to make hir abode there,
where she was pursued by many kings, lordes, and prynces. Aulus Gellius
saith (which I haue recited in my former part of the Pallace of
pleasure, the fiftenth Noeuill,) that the good Philosopher, Demosthenes,
went from Athens to Corinth, in disguised apparell, to see Lais, and to
haue hir company, But before the dore was opened, she sent one to
demaunde <span class = "smallroman">.XII.</span> C. Sestercios of
siluer: whereunto Demosthenes
answered: “I&nbsp;buy not repentance so deere.” And I beleue that
Demosthenes spake those wordes by folowyng the sentence of Diogenes, who
sayeth, that euery beast after such acte is heauy and sad. Som wryters
affirme of this Amorous Lais, that thing whych I neuer reade or hearde
of Woman: whych is, that shee neuer shewed signe or token of loue to
that man whych was desyrous to doe her seruice: nor was neuer hated of
man that knew her. Whereby we may comprehend the happe and fortune of
that amorous Woman. Shee neuer shewed semblance of great loue to any
person, and yet shee was beloued of all. If the amorous Lamia had a good
Spirite and mynde, Lais truely had no lesse. For in the art of loue she
exceeded all other women of hir detestable Arte and Scyence, as well in
Knowledge of Loue as to profite in the same. Vppon a Daye a Younge Man
of Corinth demaundying of hir, what hee shoulde say to a Woman whome hee
long tyme had loued, and made so greate sute, that thereby he was like
to fal into dispayre. “Thou shalt say,” (sayd Lais) “vnto hir, that sith
she wyl not graunt thy request, yet at least wyse it myght please hir to
suffer thee to bee hir seruant, and that shee would take in good parte
the Seruice that thou shalt doe vnto hir. Whych requeste if shee doe
graunte, then hope to attayne the ende of thy attempte, bycause wee
Women bee of such nature, as opening our mouthes to gyue some mylde and
pleasant answere to the amorous person, it is to bee thoughte that wee
haue gyuen our heart vnto hym.” An other Daye, in the presence of Lias,
one praysed the Phylosophers of Athens, saying, that they were very
honest personages, and of great learnynge. Whereunto Lais aunswered:
“I&nbsp;can not tell what great knowledg they haue, nor what science
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page306" id = "page306">306</a></span>
they studye, ne yet what bookes youre Philosophers doe reade, but thys I
am sure, that to me beynge a woman and neuer was at Athenes, I&nbsp;see
them repayre, and of Philosophers beecome amorous persons.”
A&nbsp;Theban knighte demaunded of Lais, what he might doe to enioy a
ladye wyth whose loue hee should bee surprised: Shee aunswered thus.
“A&nbsp;man that is desirous of a woman, must folow his sute, serue hir,
and suffer hir and somtymes to seeme as though he had forgotten hir. For
after that a womans heart is moued to loue, she regardeth more the
forgetfulnesse and negligence vsed towards hir, than she doth the
seruice done before.” An other Gentleman of Achaia asked hir what he
shoulde doe to a woman, whom he suspected that she had falsified hir
fayth<ins class = "addition" title = "period (full stop) missing">.</ins>
Lais aunswered, “make hir beleue that thou thinkest she
is very faythful and take from hir the occasions wherby shee hath good
cause to be vnfaythful: For if she do perceiue that thou knowest it, and
dissemblest the matter, she wyll sooner dye than amende.”
A&nbsp;gentleman of Palestine at another time inquired of hir what hee
should doe to a Woman whych he serued, and did not esteeme the seruyce
done vnto hir, ne yet gaue him thankes for the loue which hee bare hir.
Lais sayed vnto him: “If thou be disposed to serue hir no longer, let
hir not perceiue that thou hast gyuen hir ouer. For naturally we women
be tendre in loue, and hard in hatred.” Beyng demaunded by one of hir
Neyghbours what shee shoulde doe to make hir Daughter very wyse. “Shee”
(sayde Lais) “that wyll haue hir Daughter to bee good and honest, must
from her youth learne hir to feare, and in going abrode to haunte litle
company, and that she be shamefast and moderate in hir talke.” An other
of hir neighbors inquyryng of hir what shee myght doe to hir daughter
whych began to haue delyght to rome in the fieldes and wander abroade.
“The remedy” (sayde Lais) “that I finde for your daughter disposed to
that condition, is, not to suffer hir to be ydle, ne yet to be braue and
sumptuous in apparel.” This amorous gentlewoman Lais, dyed in the Citye
of Corinth, of the age of .l<span class = "smallroman">XXII.</span>
Yeares, whose death was of many matrones desired and of a great numbre
of amorous persones lamented. The thyrd amorous gentlewoman was called
Flora, which was not so auncient, ne yet of so greate renoume as Lamia
and Lais
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page307" id = "page307">307</a></span>
were, whose country also was not so famous<ins class = "correction"
title = ", for .">, </ins>For she was of Italy, and the other two of
Grecia, and although that Lamia and Lais exceded Flora in antiquity, yet
Flora surmounted them in lineage and generositie. For Flora was of noble
house, although in life lesse than chast. She was of the country of Nola
in Campania, issued of certayne Romans, Knights very famous in facts of
Armes and of great industrie and gouernement in the common wealth. When
the Father and mother of this Flora deceased, she was of the age of
<span class = "smallroman">XV.</span> yeares, indued with great riches
and singular beauty, and the very orphane of all hir kynne. For shee had
neyther brother lefte wyth whom shee myght soiourne, ne yet vncle to
gyue her good counsell. In such wyse that lyke as this young maistres
Flora had youthe, riches, lyberty and beauty, euen so there wanted
neyther baudes nor Pandores to entyce hir to fal, and allure hir to
folly. Flora seeing hir self beset in this wise, she determined to goe
into the Affrick warres, where she hazarded both in hir person and hir
honor. This dame florished and tryumphed in the tyme of the firste
Punique warres, when the Consul Mamillus was sent to Carthage, who
dispended more Money vpon the loue of Flora, than hee did vpon the chase
and pursute of his enimies. This amorous lady Flora had a writyng and
tytle fixed vpon hir gate, the effect wherof was this: <i>King, Prince,
Dictator, Consul, Censor, high Bishop, and Questor may knocke and come
in.</i> In that writyng Flora named neither emperor nor Cæsar, bycause
those two most Noble names were long tyme after created by the Romanes.
Thys Amorous Flora woulde neuer abandon hir Person, but wyth Gentlemen
of Noble House, or of greate Dygnitye and Ryches. For shee was wonte to
say that a Woman of passinge Beauty shoulde be so mutch esteemed as shee
doth esteeme and sette by hir selfe. Lias and Flora were of contrary
maners and conditions. For Lias would first bee payde, before shee
yelded the vse of hir bodye: but Flora wythout any semblance of desire
eyther of golde or siluer was contented to bee ruled by those with whom
shee committed the facte. Wherof vppon a day being demaunded the
question, she answered: “I&nbsp;gyue my body to prynces and noble
Barons, that they may deale with mee lyke Gentlemen. For I
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page308" id = "page308">308</a></span>
sweare vnto you by the Goddesse Venus, that neuer man gaue me so little,
but that I had more than I looked for, and the double of that which I
could demaund.” This Amorous lady Flora was wont many times to saye,
that a wise woman (or&nbsp;more aptly to terme her a subtyll Wench)
oughte not to demaund reward of her louer for the acceptable pleasure
which she doth hym but rather for the loue whych she beareth him,
bycause that al thinges in the world haue a certayn pryce, except loue,
which cannot bee payde or recompenced but wyth loue. All the Ambassadors
of the worlde, whych had accesse into Italy, made so greate reporte of
the Beauty and Generositie of Flora, as they dyd of the Romane common
wealth, bycause it seemed to bee a Monstrous thynge to see the Ryches of
hir house, hir trayne, hir beauty the princes and great lordes by whom
she was required, and the presents and giftes that were gyuen vnto hir.
This Amorous Flora had a continual regard to the noble house whereof
shee came touchyng the magnyficence and state of her seruyce. For albeit
that she was but a common woman, yet she was serued and honored lyke a
great lady. That day wherein she rode about the city of Rome, she gaue
occasion to be spoken of a whole month after, one inquirynge of an other
what great Romaine lords they were that kepte her company? Whose men
they were that waighted vpon her? And whose liuery they ware. What
Ladies they wer that rode in her trayne. The brauery of hir apparell,
hir great beauty and port, and the wordes spoken by the amorous
gentlemen in that troupe were not vnremembred. When this maistres Flora
waxed old, a&nbsp;yong and beautifull gentleman of Corinth, demaunded
her to wyfe, to whom she answered: “I&nbsp;know well that thou wilt not
marie, the three score yeares whych Flora hath, but rather thou desirest
to haue the twelue hundred thousand Sestercios which she hath in hir
Coffres. Content thy selfe therefore, my frende, and get thee home
agayne to Corinth from whence thou comest. For to sutch as be of myne
age great honor is borne, and reuerence done for the riches and wealth
they haue, rather than for mariage.” There was neuer in the Romane
Empyre, the lyke amorous woman that Flora was, indued wyth so many
graces and Queenelyke
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page309" id = "page309">309</a></span>
qualities, for shee was of noble house, of singuler beauty, of comely
personage, discrete in hir affayres, and besides al other comly
qualyties, very lyberall. This maistres Flora spent the most part of hir
youth in Affrica, Almayne and Gallia Transalpina. And albeit that she
would not suffre anye other but great lords to haue possession of hir
body, yet she applyed hir selfe to the spoile of those that were in
place, and to the praye of those that came from the warres. This amorous
Flora died when she was of the age of <span class = "smallroman">LXXV.</span>
yeares. She left for the principal heire of all hir goods and
Iuells<ins class = "correction" title = ". for ,">. </ins>the Romain
people, which was estemed sufficient and able to
make newe the Walles of Rome, and to raunsome and
redeme the common Wealth of the same. And bycause that shee was a
Romaine, and had made the state therefore hir heyre, the Romaines
builded in hir honor a sumptuous Temple, whych in memorye of <ins class
= "correction" title = "error for ‘Flora’">Fora</ins> was called
Florianum: and euery yeare in the memorye of hir, they celebrated hir
feast vppon the day of hir death: Suetonius Tranquillus sayeth, that the
first feaste which the Emperour Galba the second celebrated wyth in
Rome, was the feast of the amorous Flora, vpon whych daye it was lawful
for men and women, to doe what kynd of dishonesty they could deuise. And
she was estemed to be the greater saint which that day shewed her selfe
moste dissolute and wanton. And bicause that the temple Florianum, was
dedycated to amorous Flora, the Romanes had an opinion, that al women
which vpon the same day repayred to the Temple in whorish apparell,
should haue the graces and giftes that Flora had. These were the fond
opinions and maners of the auncient, which after their owne makinge and
deuises framed Gods and Goddesses, and bycause she proued vnshamefast
and rich, a&nbsp;Temple must bee erected, and Sacrifices ordayned for
hir Whorish triumphes. But that noble men and Kings haue bene rapt and
transported with the lurements of sutch notorious strumpets, is and hath
bene common in all ages. And commonly sutch infamous women be indewed
with greatest gifts and graces, the rather to noosell and dandle their
fauorers in the laps of their fadinge pleasures. But euery of them a
most speciall grace, aboue the rest. As of a Kyng not lot long agoe we

three, one the holiest, another the craftiest, and the third the

third so incident to that kinde as heat to a liuinge body. Cease wee

The lyfe and giftes of the most Famous Queene Zenobia with the letters
of the Emperour Avrelianvs to the sayde Queene, and her stoute aunswere
thereunto.</p>


<p><span class = "firstword">Zenobia</span> Queene of Palmyres, was a
right famous Gentlewoman, as diuerse Hystoriographers largely do report
and write. Who although shee was no Christian Lady, yet so worthy of
Imitation, as she was for hir vertues and heroycall facts of Immortall
prayse. By hir wysedome and stoutnesse she subdued all the empire of the
Orient, and resisted the inuincible Romans. And for that it is meete and
requisite to alleage and aduouch reasons by weight, and words by
measure, I&nbsp;wil orderly begin to recite the History of that most
famous Queene. Wherefore I say, that about the .284. Olimpiade, no long
tyme after the death of the vnhappy Emperour Decius, Valerian was chosen
Emperour by the Senate, and (as&nbsp;Trebellius Pollio his Hystorian
doth describe) he was a well learned prince, indued with manyfold
vertues, that for his speciall prayse, these wordes be recorded of him.
<i>If all the World had bene assembled to chose a good Prince, they
would not haue chosen any other but good Valerian.</i> It is also
written of hym, that in liberality he was noble, in words true, in talke
wary, in promise constant, to his frends familiar, and to his enemies
seuere, and which is more to be esteemed, he could not forget seruice,
nor yet reuenge wronge. It came to passe that in the <span class =
"smallroman">XIV.</span> yeare of his raygne, there rose sutch cruell
Warres in Asia, that forced he was to go thither in his owne person, to
resist Sapor king of the Persians, a&nbsp;very valyaunt man of Warre and
fortunate in his enterprises, which happinesse of hys not long time
after the arryuall of Valerian into Asia, hee manifested and shewed. For
beeyng betwene them such hot and cruell warres, in a skyrmish, throughe
the greate faulte of the General, (which had the conduct of the armye)
the Emperour Valerian was taken, and brought into the puissance of King
Sapor hys ennimy, whych cursed tyrant so wickedlye vsed that victory, as
hee woulde by no meanes put the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page312" id = "page312">312</a></span>
Emperour to raunsome, towards whom hee vsed such cruelty, that so oft
and so many tymes, as hee was disposed to gette vp on horsebacke hee
vsed the body of olde Valerian to serue hym for aduauntage, setting his
feete vppon the throate of that aged gentleman. In that myserable office
and vnhappy captiuity serued and dyed the good Emperour Valerian, not
wyth oute the greate sorrowe of them that knew him, and the rueful
compassion of those that sawe him, which the Romans considering, and
that neither by offre of gold, or siluer, or other meanes, they were
able to redeeme Valerian, they determined to choose for Emperour his
owne sonne called Galienus: which they did more for respect of the
father, than for any minde or corage they knew to bee in the sonne. Who
afterwardes shewed himselfe to bee farre different from the conditions
of his father Valerian, being in his enterprises a cowarde, in his
promisses a lyer, in correction cruell, towards them that serued him
vnthanckfull, (and which is worse,) hee gaue himselfe to his desires,
and yealded place to sensuality. By meanes wherof, in his tyme the
Romain Empyre more than in any others raygne, lost most prouinces and
receiued greatest shame. In factes of warre he was a cowarde, and in
gouernement of common wealth, a&nbsp;very weake and feeble man. Galienus
not caryng for the state of the Empire, became so myserable as the
Gouernors of the same gaue ouer their obedience, and in the tyme of hys
raygne, there rose vp thyrty tyrants, whych vsurped the same. Whose
names doe followe, Cyriades, Posthumus the yonger, Lollius, Victorinus,
Marius, Ingenuus, Regillianus, Aureolus, Macrianus, Machianus the

Heremianus, Timolaus, Celsus, Titus, Censorinus, Claudius, Aurelius, and
Quintillus, of whom <span class = "smallroman">XVIII</span>, were
captaynes and seruiters vnder the good Emperour Valerian. Sutch delight
had the Romanes, in that auncient world, to haue good Captaynes, as were
able to bee preferred to be Emperours. Nowe in that tyme the Romanes had
for their Captayne generall, a&nbsp;knight called Odenatus, the Prynce
of Palmerines, a&nbsp;man truely of great vertue, and of passinge
industry and hardinesse in facts of warre. This Captayne Odenatus maried
a

woman that descended of the auncient linage of the Ptolomes, <ins class
= "addition" title = "s invisible">t</ins>ometymes Kinges of Ægypt,
named Zenobia, which (if&nbsp;the historians do not deceiue&nbsp;vs) was
one of the most famous Women of the Worlde. Shee had the heart of
Alexander the great, shee possessed the riches of Cræsus, the diligence
of Pyrrhus, the trauel of Haniball, the warie foresighte of Marcellus,
and the Iustice of Traiane. When Zenobia was married to Odenatus, she
had by hir other husband, a&nbsp;sonne called Herodes, and by Odenatus
shee had two other, whereof the one was called Hyeronianus, and the
other Ptolemus. And when the Emperour Valerian was vanquyshed and taken,
Odenatus was not then in the Campe. For as all men thought, if he had
ben there, they had not receyued so greate an ouerthrow. So sone as good
Odenatus was aduertized of the defaict of Valerian, in great haste he
marched to the Roman Campe, that then was in great disorder. Whych with
greate diligence hee reassembled, and reduced the same to order, and
(holpen by good Fortune,) wythin xxx. Dayes after hee recouered all that
whych Valerian had loste, makynge the Persian kyng to flee, by meanes
whereof, and for that Odenatus had taken charge of the army, hee wanne
amonges the Romanes great reputation, and truely not with out cause: For
if in that good time he had not receyued the charge the name and glory
of the Romanes had taken ende in Asia. Duryng all thys tyme Galienus,
lyued in hys delyghtes at Myllan, wythout care or thoughte of the Common
wealth, consumynge in his wylfull vices, the Money that was leuied for
the men of war. Whych was the cause that the gouernours of the
prouinces, and Captens general, seing him to be so vicious and
neglygent, vsurped the prouinces and armies which they had in charge.
Galienus voyde of all obedience sauing of the Italians and Lombards, the
first that rose vp against him were Posthumus in Fraunce, Lollians in
Spayne, Victorinus in Affrica, Marius in Britane, Ingenuus in Germanie,
Regillianus in Denmark, Aureolus in Hungarie, Macrianus in Mesopotamia,
and Odenatus, in Syria. Before Odenatus rose against Valerian, Macrianus
enioied Mesopotamia and the greatest part of Syria, whereof Odenatus
hauing intelligence, he marched with his power agaynst him and killed
him, and discomfited all his army. The death of the Tyran Macrian being

and chose Odenatus Emperour: which Election although the Senate
publickly durst not agree vpon, yet secretly they allowed it, bycause
they receyued dayly newes, of the great Exploytes and deedes of armes
done by Odenatus, and saw on the other side the great continued follies
of Galienus. Almost three yeares and a halfe was Odenatus Emperour and
Lord of all the Orient, duringe which time he recouered all the Lands
and Prouinces lost by Galienus, and payde the Romane army all the
arrerages of their wages due vnto them. But Fortune ful of inconstancy,
suffred not this good Prynce very long to raygne. For hauing in hys
house a kinsman of hys, named Meonius, to whom he bare great good will,
for that he sawe him to be a valiant man of warre, although Ignorant of
his Enuy and couetousnesse: it chaunced vpon a day as they two rode on
huntinge, and gallopinge after the pursute of a wylde Bore, with the
very same Bore Speare which Meonius caried to strike the beast, he
killed by treason his good Cousin Odenatus. But that murder was not long
time vnreuenged. For the Borespeare wherewith he had so cruelly killed
the Emperour his Cousin, was incontinently known by the hunters which
folowed Odenatus: whervpon that day the head of Meonius was striken of.
And Galienius vnderstandinge the death of Odenatus, gaue great rewardes
and presents to them that brought him the newes, beinge so ioyfull as
the Romans wer angry to vnderstand those pitiful tydings, bycause
through the good ordre which Odenatus vsed in Asia, they had great
tranquillity and peace throughout Europa. Now after the death of thys
good Emperour Odenatus, the Armies chose one of his two Sonnes to be
Emperour of the Orient: But for that he was younge, they chose Zenobia
to be Protector of hir sonne, and gouerner ouer the sayd Orient Empyre.
Who seeing that vpon the decease of Odenatus certayne of the East
Countries began to reuolt, shee determined to open hir Treasure,
ressemble hir men of Warre, and in hir owne person to march into the
fielde: where she did sutch notable enterprises, as shee appalled hir
enemies, and made the whole world to wonder. About the age of <span
class = "smallroman">.XXXV.</span> yeares Zenobia was widow, beinge the
Tutrix of hir children, Regent of an Empyre, and Captayne
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page315" id = "page315">315</a></span>
generall of the army. In which weighty charge she vsed hir selfe so
wisely and well, as shee acquired no lesse noble name in Asia, than
Queene Semiramis did in India. Zenobia was constant in that whych she
tooke in hand, true in words, liberall, mylde, and seuere where she
ought to be, discrete, graue, and secrete in her enterprises, albeit she
was ambicious. For, not content with hir title of Gouernesse, or Regent,
she wrote and caused her selfe to be called Empresse, she loued not to
ride vpon a Mule, or in a littor, but greatly esteemed to haue great
horse in hir stable and to learne to handle and ryde them. When Zenobia
went forth of hir Tent to see the order and gouernment of hir Campe, she
continually did put on her Armure, and was well guarded with a band of
men, so that of a woman, she cared but onely for the name, and in the
facts of Armes shee craued the title of valiaunt. The Captaynes of hir
Army, neuer gaue battell, or made assault, they neuer skyrmished or did
other enterprise of warre, but she was present in her owne person, and
attempted to shewe hirselfe more hardy than any of all the troupe,
a&nbsp;thinge almost incredible in that weake and feeble kinde. The sayd
noble Queene was of stature, bigge and well proporcioned, her eyes black
and quicke, hir forehead large, hir stomak and Breastes fayre and
vpright, her Face white, and ruddy, a&nbsp;little mouth, hir Teeth so
whyte, as they seemed like a rancke of white pearles, but aboue all
things she was of sutch excellent Spirit and courage, as shee was feared
for hir stoutnesse, and beloued for her beauty. And although Zenobia was
indued with so great beauty, liberality, riches, and puissaunce, yet she
was neuer stayned with the blemish of vnchaste lyfe, or wyth other
vanity: and as hir husband Odenatus was wont to say, that after shee
felt hir selfe wyth chylde, shee neuer suffred hym to come neare her,
(sutch was hir great Chastity) sayinge that Women ought to marry rather
for children than for pleasure. She was also excellently well learned in
the Greke and Latine tongue. Shee did neuer eate but one Meale a Day.
Hir talke was verye lyttle and rare. The Meate which shee vsed for hir
repaste, was either the hanch of a Wylde Bore, or else the syde of a
Deere. Shee could drinke no Wyne, nor abyde the sent thereof. But shee
was so curyous in good and perfect Waters, as shee would gyue so great
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page316" id = "page316">316</a></span>
a Pryce for that, as is ordinaryly gyuen for Wyne bee it neuer so
excellent. So soone as the Kinges of Ægypte of Persia, and the Greekes,
were aduertized of the death of Odenatus, they sent theyr Ambassadours
to Zenobia, aswell to visite and comfort hir, as to bee her confederats
and frendes. So much was she feared and redoubted for her rare vertues.
The affayres of Zenobia beinge in sutch estate in Asia, the Emperor
Galienus died in Lombardie, and the Romanes chose Aurelianus to bee
Emperour, who although he was of a base and obscure lineage, yet hee was
of a great valiance in factes of Armes. When Aurelianus was chosen
Emperour, he made great preparacion into Asia, to inferre warres vpon
Queene Zenobia, and in all hys tyme hee neuer attempted greater
enterprise for the Romanes. When hee was arryued in Asia, the Emperour
proceded agaynst the Queene, and shee as valiantly defended hir selfe,
continually being betwene them great Alarams and skirmishes. But as
Zenobia and hir people were of lesse trauell and of better skyl in
knowledge of the Country, so they did greater harme and more anoiance
vnto theyr Enimy, and thereof receiued lesser damage. The Emperour seing
that hee should haue mutch adoe to vanquishe Zenobia by armes,
determined to ouercome hir by gentle wordes and fayre promisses: for
which cause he wrote vnto hir a letter, the tenor whereof ensueth.</p>

<p>Aurelianus Emperour of Rome and Lord of al Asia, to the right
honorable Zenobia sendeth greetyng. Although to such rebellyous Women as
thou art, it should seeme vncomely and not decente to make request, yet
if thou wylt seeke ayde of my mercy, and rendre thy selfe vnder myne
obedience, bee assured that I wyll doe thee honour, and geue pardon to
thy people. The Golde, Siluer, and other riches, within thy Pallace I am
content thou shalt enioy, together with the kingdome of Palmyres, which
thou mayest keepe duringe thy life, and leaue after thy death to whom
thou shalt think good, vpon condicion notwithstandinge, that thou
abandone all thine other Realmes and Countryes which thou haste in Asia,
and acknowledge Rome to be thy superior. Of thy vassalls, and subiectes
of Palmyres, we demaund none other obedience, but to be confederates and
frendes, so that thou breake vp thy Campe, wherewyth thou makest warre
in Asia, and disobeyest the city of Rome, wee will
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page317" id = "page317">317</a></span>
suffer thee to haue a certayne number of men of warre, so wel for the
tuicion of thy person, as for the defence of thy kingdome, and thy two
Children which thou haddest by thy husbande Odenatus. And he whom thou
louest best shal remayne with thee in Asia, and the other I will carry
with me to Rome, not as prisoner, but as hostage and pleadge from thee.
The prisoners which thou hast of ours, shalbe rendred in exchange for
those which we haue of thine, without raunsome of eyther parts<ins class

meanes thou shalt remayne honored in Asia, and I contented, will
retourne to Rome. The Gods be thy defence, and preserue our mother the
city of Rome from all vnhappy fortune.</p>

<p>The Queene Zenobia hauinge reade the letter of the Emperour
Aurelianus, without feare of the contents, incontinently made sutch
aunswere as followeth.</p>

<p>Zenobia Queene of Palmyres, and Lady of all Asia, and the kingdomes
thereof, to thee Aurelianus the Emperour, health, and consolation,
&amp;c. That thou do intitle thy selfe with the Emperour of the Romanes
I doe agree, but to presume to name thy selfe lord of the East
kingdomes, I&nbsp;say therein thou doest offend. For thou knowest wel,
that I alone am Lady Regent of all the Orient, and the only dame and
maystresse of the same. Th’one part whereof descended vnto me by lawful
Inheritaunce from my predecessors, and the other part, I&nbsp;haue won
by my prowesse and deedes of armes. Thou sayest that if I rendre
obedience vnto thee, thou wilt do me great honor: To that I aunswere,
that it were a dishonest part of me, and a deede most vniust, that the
Gods hauing created Zenobia to commaund all Asia, she should now begyn
to bee slaue and thral vnto the city of Rome. Semblably, thou saiest
that thou wylt gyue and leaue me al the golde, siluer, and other ryches
whych I haue: Whereunto I aunswer, that it is a wycked, and fond
request, to dispose the goodes of another as they were thine owne. But
thine eyes shall neuer see it, ne yet thy handes shal touche it, but
rather I hope in the Gods aboue to bestow and crye a larges of that
which thou haste at Rome, before thou finger that whych I haue and
possesse in Asia. Truely Aurelianus, the warres which thou makest
agaynst me, and thy quarell, bee most vniuste beefore the supernall
Gods, and very vnreasonable
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page318" id = "page318">318</a></span>
before men, and I for my part if I haue entred or doe take armes, it is
but to defend my self and myne. Thy comming then into Asia is for none
other purpose, but to spoile and make hauocke of that which an other
hath. And think not that I am greatly afrayde of the name of Romane
Prynce, nor yet the power of thyne huge army. For if it bee in thy
handes to gyue battell, it belongeth onely to the gods to gyue eyther to
thee or me the victory. That I remaine in fielde it is to me greate
fame, but thou to fight with a widdowe, oughtest truelye to bee ashamed.
There be come vnto myne ayde and Campe the Persians, the Medes, the
Agamennonians, the Irenees, and the Syrians, and with them all the Gods
immortall, who be wont to chastice sutch proude princes as thou art, and
to helpe poore Widowes as I am. And if it so come to passe, that the
Gods doe permit and suffre my lucke to be sutch, as thou do bereue me of
lyfe and dispoyle me of goods, yet it will be bruted at Rome, and
published in Asia, that the wofull wight Zenobia, was ouerthrowne and
slayne, in defence of hir Patrimony, and for the conseruation of hir
husbande’s honor. Labor no more then Aurelianus, to flatter and pray me,
nor yet to threaten me: requere me no more to yeelde and become thy
prisoner, nor yet to surrender that which I haue: for by doinge that I
can, I&nbsp;accomplish that I ought. For it will be sayd and noysed
through the world, (may it so come to passe as Fortune do not fauor mee)
that if the Empresse Zenobia be captiue, she was not yet vanquished. Now
touchinge my son which thou demaundest to cary with thee to Rome, truely
that request I cannot abide, and mutch lesse do meane to graunt, knowing
full well that thy house is stored full of manyfolde vices, where myne
is garnished with many notable Philosophers: whereby if I leaue vnto my
Children no great heapes of goods, yet they shalbe wel taught and
instructed: For the one half of the day they spend in Learninge, and the
other halfe in exercise of Armes. For conclusion of thy demaund, and
finall aunswere, thereunto, I&nbsp;pray thee trauayle no more by letters
to write vnto mee, ne yet by ambassage to spende any furder talke, but
attend vntill our controuersie bee decided rather by force of Armes than
by vttered wordes. The Gods preserue thee.</p>

<p>It is sayd that Aurelianus, receiuing that aunswere did reioyce, but
when he had red it, he was greatly offended, which incontinently hee
made to bee known, by gathering together his Camp, and besieginge the
Citty wherein Zenobia was. And Aurelianus, wroth and outraged with that
aunswere, although his army was weary and halfe in dispayre
(by&nbsp;reason of the longe Warres,) yet he vsed sutch diligence and
expedition in the siege of that place, as the Queene was taken and the
city rased: which done, the Emperour Aurelianus retourned to Rome,
caryinge with him Zenobia, not to doe hir to death, but to tryumph ouer
her. At what tyme to see that Noble Lady goe on foote, and marche before
the tryumphinge Chariot bare footed, charged with the burden of heauy
chaynes, and hir two children by hir side: truly it made the Romane
Matrons to conceyue great pity, being wel knowen to al the Romans, that
neither in valorous deedes, nor yet in vertue or chastity, any man or
woman of hir time did excell hir. The dayes of the triumph being done,
all the noble Ladies of Rome assembled and repayred to Zenobia, and vsed
vnto her great and honorable entertaynement, giuing hir many goodly
presentes and rewards. And Zenobia liued in the company of those noble
Matrons the space of <span class = "smallroman">.X.</span> yeares before
she dyed, in estimation like a Lucrecia, and in honour like a Cornelia.
And if Fortune had acompanied hir personage, so well as vertue and
magnanimity, Rome had felt the egrenesse of hir displeasure, and the
whole world tasted the sweetnesse of hir Regiment. But nowe leaue we of,
any longer to speak of Zenobia, that wee may direct our course to the
hard fate of a King’s daughter, that for loue maried a simple person
bred in hir father’s house, who in base parentage, and churlishe kynde
coulde not be altered: but shewed the fruicts of brutishnesse: tyll Lady
Fortune pityinge the Ladie’s case: prouided for her better dayes, and
chastized her vnkinde companion with deserts condigne for sutch a
matche.</p>

THE FIFTEENTH NOUELL.</a></h3>

<p class = "summary">
Evphimia the Kyng of Corinth’s daughter fell in love with Acharisto, the
seruaunt of her father, and besides others which required hir in
mariage, she disdayned Philon the King of Peloponesus, that loued hir
very feruently. Acharisto conspiring against the Kyng, was discouered,
tormented, and put in prison, and by meanes of Evphimia deliuered. The
King promised his daughter and kingdome to him that presented the head
of Acharisto, Evphimia so wrought, as hee was presented to the King. The
King gaue him his daughter to wyfe and when he died made him his heyre.
Acharisto began to hate his wyfe, and condemned hir to death as an
adulteresse. Philon deliuered hir: and vpon the sute of hir subiects,
she is contented to mary him, and therby he is made Kynge of
Corinth:</p>


<p><span class = "firstword">Constancy</span> in honest loue (being a
perfect vertue, and a precious ornament to the beloued, induinge eyther,
besides ioy and contentacion, with immortall fame and Glory,) hath in it
selfe these onely marks and properties to be knowen by, Chastity, and
toleration of aduersity: For as the mynde is constant in loue, not
variable, or geuen to chaunge, so is the body continent, comely, honest
and pacient of Fortunes plages. A&nbsp;true constant minde is moued with
no sugred persuasions of frendes, is diuerted with no eloquence,
terrified with no threats, is quiet in all motions. The blustering
blasts of parents wrath, cannot remoue the constant mayde from that
which she hath peculiarly chosen to hir selfe. The rigorous rage of
frendes, doth not dismay the louing man from the embracement of hir whom
he hath amongs the rest selecte for his vnchanged feere. A&nbsp;goodly
example of constant and noble loue this history ensuing describeth,
although not like in both, yet in both a semblable constancy. For
Euphimia, a&nbsp;kings daughter, abandoneth the great loue borne vnto
hir by Philon, a&nbsp;yong prince, to loue a servant of hir father’s,
with whom she perseuered in great constancy, for all his false and
ingratefull dealings towards hir. Philon seeing his loue despised neuer
maried vntill he maried hir,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page321" id = "page321">321</a></span>
whom afterwards he deliuered from the false surmised treason of hir
cancred and malicious husband. Euphimia fondly maried agaynst hir
father’s will, and therefore deseruedly afterwards bare the penaunce of
hir fault: and albeit she declared hir selfe to be constant, yet duty to
louinge Father ought to haue withdrawen hir rash and heady loue. What
daungers do ensue sutch like cases, examples be rife, and experience
teacheth. A&nbsp;great dishonour it is for the Lady and Gentlewoman to
disparage hir noble house with mariage of hir inferior: yea and great
griefe to the parents to see their children obstinate and wilfull in
carelesse loue. And albeit the Poet Propertius describeth the vehement
loue of those that be noble, and haue wherewith in loue to be liberall,
in these verses:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p><i>Great is the fayth of Loue,</i></p>
<p class = "indent"><i>the constant mynde doth mutch auayle:</i></p>
<p><i>And hee that is well fraught with wealth,</i></p>
<p class = "indent"><i>in Loue doth mutch preuayle.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Yet the tender Damosell or louing childe, be they neuer so noble or
rich, ought to attend the father’s tyme and choyse, and naturally
encline to parent’s will and likinge, otherwise great harme and
detriment ensue: for when the Parentes see the disobedience or rather
rebellious mynde of theyr childe, their conceiued sorrow for the same,
so gnaweth the rooted plante of naturall loue, as either it hastneth
their vntimely death, or else ingendreth a heape of melancholie humors:
whych force them to proclaime defiance and bytter cursse against their
propre fruit, vpon whom (if&nbsp;by due regard they had bene ruled) they
would haue pronounced the sweete blessyng that Isaac gaue to Iacob, the
mother’s best beloued Boye: yea and that displeasure may chaunce to
dispossesse them of that, whych should haue bene the onely comfort and
stay of the future age. So that neglygence of parent’s hest, and
carelesse heede of Youthfull head, breedeth double woe, but specially in
the not aduised Chylde: who tumbleth himselfe first into the breach of
diuine lawes, to the cursses of the same, to parent’s wrath, to orphan’s
state, to begger’s lyfe, and into a sea of manifold miseries. In whom
had obedyence ruled, and reason taken place, the hearte myght haue bene
satisfied, the parent wel pleased: the life
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page322" id = "page322">322</a></span>
ioyfully spent, and the posteritie successively tast the fruits that
elders haue prepared. What care and sorrow, nay what extremetie the
foresayde Noble Gentlewoman susteined, for not yelding to hir father’s
minde, the sequele shall at large declare. There was sometimes in
Corinth, a&nbsp;Citty of Grecia, a&nbsp;Kinge, which had a daughter
called Euphimia, very tenderly beloued of hir father, and being arriued
at the age of mariage, many Noble men of Grecia made sute to haue hir to
wife. But amongs al, Philon the young king of Peloponesus, so fiercely
fell in love wyth hir, as he thought he could no longer liue, if he were
maried to anye other: for which cause her father knowing him to be a
King, and of singular beautye, and that he was far in loue wyth his
Daughter, would gladly haue chosen him to be his sonne in lawe,
persuading hir that she should liue with him a lyfe so happy as was
possyble for any noble lady matched wyth a Gentleman, were he neuer so
honorable. But the daughter by no meanes would consent vnto hir father’s
wyll, alleaging vnto him diuers and sundry consideracions wherby hir
nature by no meanes would agree, nor heart consente to ioyne wyth
Philon. The king aboue all worldly thynges loued his fayre daughter: and
albeit hee would fayne haue broughte to passe, that she should haue
taken him to husband, yet he would not vse the father’s authoritie, but
desired that Loue rather than force should mach his daughter, and
therfore for that tyme was contented to agree vnto hir wyll. There was
in the Court a young man borne of hir Father’s bondman, whych hyght
Acharisto, and was manumised by the kinge, who made him one of the
Esquiers for hys body, and vsed his seruyce in sundrye enterpryses of
the warres, and bicause hee was in those affayres very skilfull, of
bolde personage, in conflicts and battayles very hardy, the king did
very much fauor him, aswell for that he had defended him from manifold
daungers, as also bycause he had deliuered him from the treason
pretended against him by the kyng of the Lacedemonians: whose helpe and
valyance, the king vsed for the murder and destruction of the sayde
Lacedemonian king. For whych valiant enterpryse, he bountifully
recompenced him wyth honorable prefermentes and stately reuenues. Vpon
this yong man Euphimia fixed hir amorous eyes, and fell so farre in
loue, as vpon him alone
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page323" id = "page323">323</a></span>
she bent hir thoughtes, and all hir louing cogitations. Whereof
Acharisto being certified, and well espying and marking hir amorous
lookes, nouryshed with lyke flames the fire wherewyth she burned.
Notwythstanding his loue was not so feruently bent vpon hir personage,
as his desire was ambicious for that she shoulde be hir father’s onely
heyre, and therfore thought that he should be a most happy man, aboue al
other of mortall kynde, if he myght possesse that inheritance. The king
perceiuing that loue, told his daughter, that she had placed her minde
in place so straunge, as hee had thought hir wysdome would haue more
warely foreseen, and better wayed hir estate and birth, as com of a
princely race, and would haue demed sutch loue, farre vnworthy hir
degree: requiringe hir wyth fatherly words, to withdraw hir settled
mynde and to ioyne with him in choyse of husbande, for that he had none
other worldly heire but hir, and tolde hir how he ment to bestow hir
vppon sutch a personage, as a most happy life she should leade, so long
as the destenies were disposed to weaue the Webbe of her Predestined
life: and therefore was resolved to Espouse hir vnto that noble
gentleman Philon. Euphimia hearkned to this vnliked tale, and with
vnliked words refused hir fathers hest, protesting vnto him sutch
reasons to like effect as shee did before, therby to draw him from his
conceiued purpose, wherunto the wise king hauing made replye, continuing
his intended mynde, at length in ragyng wordes, and stormed mind, he
sayd vnto Euphimia: “How mutch the sweter is the wyne, the sharper is
the egred sawce thereof. I&nbsp;speake this Parable, for that thou not
knowing or greatlye regarding the gentle disposition of thy father’s
nature, in the ende mayst so abuse the same, as where hitherto he hath
bene curteous and benigne, he may become through thy disordred deedes,
ryghte sowre and sharpe:” and without vtterance of further talke,
departed. Who resting euill content wyth that fonde fyxed Loue, thoughte
that the next way to remedy the same, was to tell Acharisto how
greuously he toke his presumed fault, and in what heinous parte he
conceiued his ingratitude, and how for the benefits which liberally he
had bestowed vpon him, he had broughte and enticed hys daughter to loue
him, that was farre vngreeable her estate. And therfore
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page324" id = "page324">324</a></span>
he called hym before hym, and with reasons firste declared the duetye of
a faythfull seruaunt to his Soueraigne lord, and afterwards hee sayd:
That if the receyued benefits were not able to lette him know what were
conuenient and seemely for hys degree, but would perseuere in that which
he had begon, he would make him feele the iust displeasure of a
displeased Prince, whereby hee shoulde repent the tyme that euer hee was
borne of Woman’s wombe. These woordes of the Kyng seemed greeuous to
Acharisto, and not to moue hym to further anger hee seemed as though
that (being fearfull of the Kyng’s displeasure) he did not loue his
daughter at all, but sayd vnto hym, that he deserued not to bee so
rebuked, for that it lay not in his power to wythstand hir loue, the
same procedyng of hir own good wyll and lyberty: and that hee for his
part neuer requyred loue: if shee did bend hir mynd to loue hym, hee
could not remedye that affection, for that the freewyll of sutch
vnbrydled appetite rested not in hym to reforme. Notwythstandyng,
bycause he vnderstoode hys vnwyllyng mind, he from that tyme forth would
so endeuor hymselfe as he shoulde well perceyue that the vnstayde mynde
of the young gentlewoman Euphimia, was not incensed by hym, but
voluntarily conceyued of hir selfe. “You shall doe well” (sayde the
kyng) “if the effecte procede accordinge to the promise: and the more
acceptable shall the same bee vnto mee, for that I desyre it shoulde so
come to passe.” The king liked wel these words although that Acharisto
had conceiued within the plat of his entended mind, som other treason.
For albeit that he affirmed before the kyng’s owne face, that hee would
not loue his daughter, yet knowing the assured wil of the louyng
gentlewoman, hee practised the mariage, and like an vnkind and wretched
man, deuised conuenient tyme to kil him: and fully bent to execute that
cruel enterpryse, he attempted to corrupt the chiefest men about him,
promising promocions vnto some, to some he assured restitucion of
reuenewes, which by father’s fault they had lost beefore, and to other
golden hilles, so that hee mighte attayne by slaughter of the king, to
wynne a kingly state and kingdome: which the sooner he peruaded himself
to acquire, if in secrete silence, they coulde put vp that which by
generall voice they had agreed. And although
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page325" id = "page325">325</a></span>
they thought themselues in good assurance, that theyr enterpryse could
take no ill successe, by reason of their sounde and good discourse
debated amonges themselues for the accomplishement thereof, yet it
fortuned that one of the conspiracy (as&nbsp;commonlye in sutch lyke
trayterous attemptes it chaunceth) beeynge wyth hys beloued Ladye, and
shee makyng mone that little Commodytye succeeded of hir Loue for hir
Aduauncement, brake out into these wordes: “Hold thy peace” (sayde hee:)
“for the tyme wyll not bee longe before thou shalt bee one of the
chiefest Ladies of this land.” “Howe can that bee?” (sayde hys Woman.)
“No more adoe?” (quod the Gentleman:) “Cease from further questions, and
bee merrye: for wee shall enioye together, a&nbsp;verye Honourable and a
quyete Lyfe.” When hir Louer was departed, the gentlewoman went to an
other of hir gossips very iocunde, and tolde hir what hir Louer had
sayd: and shee then not able to keepe Counsell, wente and tolde an
other: in such wyse as in the ende it came to the eares of the King’s
steward’s wyfe, and she imparted the same vnto hir husband, who marking
those words, like a man of great wisedome and experience, did verily
beleue that the same touched the daunger of the king’s person: and as a
faythfull seruant to his lorde and maister, diligently harkned to the
mutteringe talke murmured in the Court, by him which had tolde the same
to his beloued Lady: and knowinge that it proceeded from Acharisto,
which was an obstinate and sedicious varlet, and that he with three or
four other his familiars, kept secret company in corners, iuged that
which he first coniectured, to be most certayne and true: wherefore
determined to moue the king thereof, and vpon a day finding him alone,
he sayd vnto him, that the fidelity and good will wherewith he serued
him, and the desire which he had to see hym lyue in longe and prosperous
Estate, made hym to attend to the salfegard of hys person, and to
hearken vnto sutch as should attempt to daunger the same: for which
cause, marking and espying the doings of certayne of his chamber (whose
common assemblies and priuy whisperings mislyking) he feared least they
conspiring with Acharisto, shoulde worcke treason, for berieuinge of his
life: and to th’ intent their endeuours might be preuented, and his
safety foreseene, he thought good to reueale the same to
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page326" id = "page326">326</a></span>
hys Maiesty. Then he tolde the King the words that were spoken by the
first Gentlewoman, to one or two of her companions, and disclosed the
presumptions which he had seene and perceyued touchinge the same. Amongs
the ill conditions of men, there is nothinge more common than Poyson,
Conspiracies, and Treason of Prynces and great Lordes: and therefore
euery little suspicion presuming sutch perill, is a great demonstration
of lyke myschiefe: which made the Kyng to geue credit to the Woords of
hys Steward, hauing for hys long experience knowen him to be faythfull,
and trusty. And sodaynly he thought that Acharisto attempted the same,
that after hys death, by mariage of Euphimia, he might be the Inheritour
of hys Kyngdome: the beliefe whereof, and the singular credite which he
reposed in hys Steward, besides other thinges, caused hym to commaund
the captayne of hys Guard to apprehend those 4 of whom hys Steward told
hym, and Acharisto, committinge them to seuerall Prisons. Then he sent
hys Officers to examyne them, and found vpon their confessions, the
accusation of his steward to be true: but Acharisto, although the whole
effecte of the Treason was confessed by those foure conspirators that
were apprehended, and aduouched to his Face, and for all the Tormentes
wherewith he was racked and cruciated, yet still denied, that eyther he
was authour of the enterprise, or partaker of a treason so wicked: then
the king incontinently caused the foure Gentlemen of hys Chamber to be
rewarded accordinge to the worthinesse of their offence, and were put to
death, and Acharisto to be repryued in sharpe and cruell prison, vntill
with torments he should be forced to confesse that which he knew to be
most certayne and true by the euidence of those that were done to death.
Euphimia for the imprisonment of Acharisto, conceiued incredible sorrow,
and vneths could be persuaded, that hee would imagine, mutch lesse
conspyre, that abhominable fact, aswell for the loue which Acharisto
seemed to beare vnto hir, as for the great good wyl wherewith he was
assured that she bare vnto hym, and therefore the death of the kyng to
be no lesse griefe vnto him, than the same woulde be to hir selfe, the
Kyng being hir naturall and louing father: Acharisto thought on the
other side, that if hee might speake with Euphimia, a&nbsp;way would be
founde eyther for hys
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page327" id = "page327">327</a></span>
escape, or else for hys delyuery. Whereupon Acharisto beinge in this
deliberation, found meanes to talke wyth the Iaylor’s wyfe, and
intreated hir to shewe hym so mutch fauour, as to procure Euphimia to
come vnto him: she accordingly brought to passe, that the yong
Gentlewoman in secrete wise came to speake wyth thys trayterous varlet,
who so soone as he sawe hir, shedinge from hys eyes store of teares,
pitifully complayninge, sayd vnto hir: “I&nbsp;know Euphimia, that the
kinge your father doth not inclose me in this cruell prison, ne yet
afflicteth me wyth these miserable torments, for any suspicion he
conceyueth of me for any intended fact, but only for the loue which I
beare you, and for the like, (for whych I render humble thanks) that you
do beare to me: and because that I am wery of this wretched state, and
know that nothing else can rid me from this paynefull Lyfe, but onely
death, I&nbsp;am determined wyth myne owne propre hands to cut the
threed of life wherewith the destinies hitherto haue prolonged the same,
that thys my breathinge Ghoast, which breatheth forth these doleful
playntes, may flee into the Skyes, to rest it selfe amonges the restfull
spirites aboue, or wandre into the pleasaunte hellish fieldes, amongs
the shadows of Creusa, Aeneas wyfe, or else wyth the ghost of
complayning Dido. But ere I did the same, I&nbsp;made myne humble prayer
to the maiesty diuine, that hee would vouchsafe to shew me so much
grace, as before I dye, I&nbsp;myghte fulfil my couetous eyes with sight
of you, whose ymage still appeareth before those greedy Gates, and
fansie representeth vnto my myndfull heart. Which great desired thing,
sith God aboue hath graunted, I&nbsp;yeld him infinit thankes, and sith
my desteny is sutch, that sutch must be the end of loue, I&nbsp;doe
reioyce that I muste dye for your sake, which only is the cause that the
King your father so laboureth for my death: I&nbsp;neede not to molest
you wyth the false euidence giuen against me, by those malicious
villaines, that be already dead, which onely hath thus incensed the
Kinge’s Wrathe and heauy rage agaynst mee: whereof I am so free, as
worthilye they bee executed for the same: for if it were so, then true
it is, (and as lyghtly you myght beleue) that I neuer knew what Loue you
beare mee, and you lykewyse did neuer knowe, the loue I bare to you: and
therefore you may thinke that so impossible is the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page328" id = "page328">328</a></span>
one, as I dyd euer meane, thinke, or ymagine any harme or peryll to your
father’s person. To be short, I&nbsp;humbly do besech you to beleue,
that so faythfully as man is able to loue a woman, so haue I loued you:
and that it may please you to bee so myndfull of me in thys fadyng Lyfe,
as I shal be of you in that life to come.” And in sayinge so, wyth face
all bathed in teares, he clypped hir about the myddle, and fast
imbracing hir said: “Thus takinge my last farewell of you (myne onely
life and ioy) I&nbsp;commende you to the gouernement of the supernall
God, and my selfe to death, to be dysposed as pleaseth him.” Euphimia,
which before was not persuaded that Acharisto was guylty of that deuised
Treason, nowe gaue full belyefe and credite to his wordes, and Weeping
wyth him for company, comforted him so wel as she could, and bidding him
to bee of good chere, she sayde, that she would seeke such meanes as for
hir sake and loue he should not dye: and that before longe time did
passe, shee would help him out of prison. Acharisto, although he vttered
by ruful voice that lamentable talke, for remedye to ridde himselfe from
pryson, yet he did but fayne all that he spake, addyng further: “Alas,
Euphimia, do not incurre your Father’s wrath to please my minde: suffer
me quietly to take that death, which sinister Fortune and cruell fate
hath prouided to abridge my dayes.” Euphimia, vanquished with
inspeakable griefe and burning passion of loue, said: “Ah, Acharisto,
the onely ioy and comfort of my lyfe, do not pierce my heart with such
displeasant wordes: for what should I do in this wretched world, yf you
for my sake should suffre death? Wherfore put away that cruel thought,
and be content to saue your Lyfe, that hereafter in ioye and myrth you
may spend the same: trusting that yf meanes may be founde for your
dispatche from hence, we shal liue the reste of our prolonged Lyfe
together, in sweete and happy dayes: for my Father is not made of stone
flint, nor yet was nourced of Hircan Tigre: he is not so malicious but
that in tyme to come hee may be made to know the true discourse of thine
innocent life, and hope thou shalt atteyne his fauour more than euer
thou didst before, the care whereof onely leaue to me, and take no
thought thy selfe: for I make promise vpon myne assured faith to brynge
the same to passe: wherefore giue ouer thy conceyued
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page329" id = "page329">329</a></span>
gryefe, and bende thy selfe to lyue so merie a life, as euer gentleman
did, trained vp in court as thou hast bene.” “I&nbsp;am content,” said
Acharisto, “thus to doe. The Gods forbid that I should declyne my hearte
and mynde from thy behest, who of thy wonted grace doest seeke
continuance of my Lyfe, but rather, sweete Euphimia, than thou shouldest
suffre any daunger to performe thy promise, I&nbsp;make request (for the
common loue betwene vs both) to leaue me in this present dangerous
state: rather would I lose my lyfe than thou shouldest hazard the least
heare of thy heade for my releefe.” “Wee shall be both salfe ynough,
(aunswered Euphimia) for my deuice proceedinge from a woman’s heade,
hath already drawen the plot of thy deliueraunce.” And with those wordes
they both did end their talke, whose trickling teares did rather finishe
the same, than willing mynds: and eyther of them geeuing a kysse vnto
the Tower Walle, wherein Acharisto was fast shutte, Euphimia departed
turmoyled wyth a Thousande amorous Pryckes, and ceased not but firste of
all to corrupt and winne the Iayler’s Wyfe, whose husband was sent forth
on businesse of the king’s: the conclusion of which practise was, that
when shee caried meate to Acharisto, according to the order appoynted,
she should fayne hirselfe to be violently dispoyled of the Pryson Key by
Acharisto, who taking the same from hir: should shut hir in the Prison
and escape, and when hir husband did returne, shee should make complaynt
of the violence done vnto hir: accordinge to which deuise, the practyse
was accomplished: And when hir husbande returned home, hearing his wyfe
crie out within the Tower, was maruayllously amazed, and vnderstandinge
that Acharisto was fled, (ignoraunt of the pollicy betwene his Wyfe and
Euphemia,) hee fell into great rage, and speedely repayred to the Kynge,
and tolde him what had chaunced. The Kinge thinking that the breach of
Prison was rather through the woman’s simplicity than purposed malice,
did mitigate his displeasure, howbeit forthwith he sent out scouts to
spy, and watch into what place Acharisto was gone, whose secret flight,
made all their trauayle to be in vayne. Then the Kinge when hee saw that
he could not be found, made Proclamation throughout his realme, that who
so would bringe vnto him the head of Acharisto, should haue to Wyfe hys
onely Daughter, and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page330" id = "page330">330</a></span>
after hys decease shoulde possesse his Kingdome for Dowry of that
mariage. Many knightes did put themselues in redinesse to atchieue that
enterprise, and aboue al, Philon was the chiefe, not for gredinesse of
the kingdome, but for loue which hee bare vnto the Gentlewoman. Whereof
Acharisto hauinge intelligence, and perceyuinge that in no place of
Europa hee could bee safe and sure from daunger, for the multitude of
them which pursued him vnto death, caused Euphimia to vnderstand the
miserable Estate wherein hee was. Euphimia which bent hir minde, and
employed hir study for his safegarde, imparted hir loue which shee bare
to Acharisto, to an aged Gentlewoman, which was hir nurse and
gouernesse, and besought hir that she would intreat hir sonne called
Sinapus, (one very well beloued of the king) to reach his help vnto hir
desire, that Acharisto might retourne to the court agayn. The Nourse
like a wyse woman lefte no persuasion vnspoken, nor counsell
vnremembred, which she thought was able to dissuade the yong gentlewoman
from hir conceiued loue: but the wound was so deepely made, and hir
hearte so greuously wounded with the three forked arrows of the little
blinde archer Cupide, that despising all the reasons of hir beloued
nurse, shee sayde, how she was firmely bent eyther to runne from hir
father, and to seke out Acharisto, to sustaine wyth him one equall
fortune, or else with hir owne hands to procure death, if some remedy
were not found to recouer the king’s good grace for the returne of
Acharisto. The Nurse vanquished with pity of the yong mayden, fearinge
both the one and the other daunger that myght ensue, sent for Sinapus,
and vppon their talke together, Euphimia and hee concluded, that
Acharisto should bee brought agayne vnto the Courte, and that she hir
selfe should present him to the King: wherein should want no kinde of
diligence vntill the Kyng did entertayne him agayne for his faythfull
seruaunt, as he was wont to do. Vpon which resolution, Acharisto was
sent for, and being come, Sinapus and Euphimia together with the nurse
tolde hym in what sort they three had concluded touchinge his health and
safegarde: which of him being well lyked, did giue them humble thankes:
and then Sinapus went vnto the kyng, and told him, that there was one
newly arriued at Corinth, to make a present vnto his grace of the head
of
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page331" id = "page331">331</a></span>
Acharisto. At which newes the kynge shewed hymselfe so ioyfull, as if
hee had gotten an other Kingdome: and beinge placed vnder his cloath of
state, with his Counsell and Princely trayne about hym, tellinge them
the cause of that assembly, commaunded hym that brought those news, to
bring the party forth newely come vnto the City to present the head of
Acharisto before the presence of the King, who no sooner looked vpon
him, but fell into sutch a rage, as the fire seemed to flame out of his
angry eyes, and commaunded him presently to be taken and put to death.
But Acharisto falling downe vpon hys knees, humbly besought his maiesty
to geeue him leaue to speake: but the kinge not suffering him to vtter
one word commaunded hym away. Then the Counsellours and other Lords of
the Court, intreated his grace to heare him: at whose requestes and
supplications he seemed to be content. Then Acharisto began to say:
“Most sacred Prynce, and redoubted souerayne Lord, the cause of this my
presumptuous repaire before your maiesty, is not to shew my selfe guilty
of thy late deuised conspiracy, ne yet to craue pardon for the same, but
to satisfie your Maiesty, wyth that contented desire, whych by
Proclamation ye haue pronounced through your highnesse Realmes and
dominions: which is, to offer this heade for reuenge of the faulte
vniustlye layed vnto my charge by those foure, which worthily haue
tasted the deserued payne of theyr offense. Wherfore I am come hither of
myne owne accord, to shew the loue and greate desyre, whych euer I had
to serue and please your Maiesty: and for that I would not consume my
life in your displeasure, I&nbsp;make offer of the same to your
mercifull wyll and dysposition, chosynge rather to die, and leaue your
maiesty satisfied and contented, than to lyue in happy state, your
princely minde displeased: but desyrous that your maiesty should know
myne innocence, I&nbsp;humblye besech your grace to heare what I can
say, that my fidelity maye bee throughly vnderstanded, and the
wickednesse of the Varlets, mine accusers wel wayed and considered.”
Then he began to rehearse all the things done by hym for the seruyce of
his crowne and maiestye, and finally into what daunger he did put
himself, when he kylled the Lacedemonian king, that went about by
treason to murder him: whych enterpryse might appeare vnto
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page332" id = "page332">332</a></span>
him to bee a sure and euident testimony, that hee ment nothinge hurtfull
or preiudiciall to his highnesse: and that hee esteemed not his life,
when hee aduentured for his seruice and sauegard to employ the same: and
after these alleaged causes, he added briefly, that the loue which his
maiesty knew to be betweene him and Euphimia his Daughter, ought to haue
persuaded him, that he had rather haue suffered death himselfe, than
commit a thing displeasant to Euphimia. And knowing that a more
offensive thynge coulde not chaunce to hir, than the vilent death of her
father, hee myghte well thyncke that hee woulde haue deuysed the death
of a Thousande other, rather than that horible and abhominable deede,
sutch as hys greatest Ennemy woulde neuer haue done, mutch lesse hee
whych was bounde vnto hym by so many Receyued Benefittes, for whose
seruice and preseruacion he had dedicated and vowed hys Lyfe and Soule:
but if so be his maiestie’s rancor and displeasure could not be
mitigated, but by doinge him to death, hee desired that none of his
alleaged reasons should bee accepted, and therefore was there ready to
sacrifice his life at his maiestie’s disposition and pleasure. Acharisto
by nature could tel his tale excedingly well, and the more his tongue
stode him in seruice, the greater appeared his eloquence: whych so
pierced the minde of the king and persuaded the Counsellers, and other
of the Court, as he was demed giltlesse of the treason: and the matter
was so debated, and the King intreated to graunt him pardon, as he was
accompted most worthy of his fauour. Then the kyng, by the aduise of hys
Counsell, was perswaded, that by force of hys proclamation, hys daughter
should be giuen to Acharisto in mariage, and his kingedome for a dowrie,
bicause hee had offered his owne heade, accordyng to the effecte of the
same. So the kinge repentinge himselfe that he had offended Acharisto,
in the end agreed to the aduise of his Counsell, and gaue him his
daughter to wife: whereof Euphimia was so ioyful, as they bee that
atteyne the summe of their heart’s desire. The father liued one whole
yeare after this mariage, and Euphimia so pleasant a life for a certaine
time, as was possible for any Gentlewoman. Hir father was no sooner
dead, but the vnkinde man, nay rather brute beaste, had forgotten all
the benefits receyued of his kinde and louing wife: and hauing by hir
onelye
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page333" id = "page333">333</a></span>
meanes got a Kingdome, began to hate hir so straungely, as he could not
abide hir sight, (sutch is the property of cancred obliuion, which after
it crepeth into ambicious heads, neuer hath minde of passed amitie, ne
regardeth former benefite, but like a monster and deadly ennimy to
humaine nature, ouerwhelmeth in his bottomlesse gulfe all pietie and
kindnesse) and determined in the ende for recompence of sutch great good
turnes, to despoyle hir of hir Lyfe. Howe thinke you, fayre Ladies, was
not this a fayre rewarde for the loue, the trauailes and sorrowes
susteined for this ingrate and villanous man, by that royal lady, to
saue his life, and to take him to husband? Here is manifest
(<i>probatum</i>) that in a vile and seruyle minde, no vertue, no duety,
no receiued benefites can be harboured. Here is a lesson for yong
Gentlewomen to beware howe they contemne and despise the graue aduise of
theyr auncient fathers. Here they may see the damage and hurt that
vnaduised youth incurreth, when neglectyng theyr Parents holesome
admonitions, they gyue themselues to the loue of sutch as be vnworthy
theyr estate and callyng. For what should ayle the Gentle pucell borne
of gentle bloud but to match her selfe in like affinity, and not to care
for curryshe kind, or race of churle. Bee there no Gentlemen to be found
of personage and beauty worthy to ioyne in loue wyth them? Bee they so
precious in nature or tender in education as theyr lyke can not be
vouchsafed to couple in mariage yoke? Compare the glysteringe gold to
drossie durte, and sutch is the difference betweene gentle and vngentle.
But perhaps bringyng vp may alter nature, and custome transforme defect
of birth: as Licurgus the lawemaker dyd trye betwene the Currish whelpe
and the Spanyell kinde, both by trayning vp running to their contraries,
the Spanyel not vsed to hunt eigre vpon the potage dishe, the other
nouseled in that pastime pursuing his game. But that Metamorphosis is
seldome seene amongs humane sort, and therfore I aduise the gentle kind,
to matche themselues in equall lotte, and not to trust Sir Custome’s
curtesie in choyse of feere. Returne we then to vnkind Acharisto, who
now in full possession of his desired praie, reuertinge to his puddle of
carlishe will and cancred nature, after many thousand wronges don to his
most noble and gentle Quene, accused hir to be an adulteresse, and as
one indeede,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page334" id = "page334">334</a></span>
(although most innocent) she was condemned to the mercilesse fire.
Philon, Kyng of Peloponesus, which (as&nbsp;we haue sayd before) loued
Euphimia as he did the balles of his owne eyes, vnderstanding the
crueltye that this wicked Man vsed towards hir, to whom both his lyfe
and Kyngdome did belonge, moued wyth nobility of mynd, determined to
declare to Euphimia the inward feruent loue which he bare hir, and to
chastise Acharisto for his ingratitude with due correction. Wherfore
depely debating wyth himselfe of this aduenture, thus he sayde: “Now is
the time Euphimia, that Philon shewe what faythful Loue he hath euer
borne vnto thee, and that he delyuer thee both from the present daunger
wherein thou art, and from the hands of that vnkynde wretche, that is
farre vnworthy of sutch a wife: for if thou haddest agreed to thy
father’s wyll, and yelded to the pursute of him that loued thee beste,
thou haddest no neede of rescue nowe, ne yet bene in perill of the
wastfull flames of fire, which be ready to consume thy flesh and tender
corps, full tenderly sometimes beloued of thy deare father, and of thy
louyng frend Philon.” When he had spoken those wordes, hee earnestly
disposed him self vpon that enterpryse. There was in those daies a
custome in Corinth, that they which were condemned to death, were caried
<span class = "smallroman">III.</span> miles forth of the City, and
there the sentence pronounced against them, were put to execution.
Philon hauyng intelligence hereof, did put in readinesse a good troupe
of horsemen, and being secretly imbarked, arriued at Corinth, and
closely the nyght before Euphimia should be brought to the fire, harde
by the place where the miserable Lady should be burnt, into a woode he
conueyed his People: and so soone as the Sergeants and officers were
approched neere the place wyth the lady, he issued forth, and did set
vpon the throng, not sufferyng one of them to remayne aliue, to carye
newes. When he had delyuered Euphimia from that present daunger of hir
lyfe, and the companye dispercled, he sayd to the Queene: “Nowe thou
mayst see (fayre Queene) the diuersitie, betwene the disloyaltie and
vnkindenesse of Acharisto, and the faith and loue of Philon. But for
that I meane not to leaue hys ingratitude vnrevenged, thou shalt staye
here, vntyll thou heare newes of the due chastisment which I shall gyue
hym.” Those
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page335" id = "page335">335</a></span>
dire and cruell words foretold of hir husband’s death moued hir honest
and Pryncely hearte that by no meanes could bee altered from the gentle
nature, which it first had tasted and receiued: and althoughe shee had
suffred Mortall and Solempne iniury of hir vnkynde husbande for
Manyfolde Benefites, yet (shee good gentlewoman) woulde permyt no duetye
of a trustye and faythfull Wyfe vnperformed. Wherefore shee besoughte
Philon vpon her knees, not to procede to further reuenge of Acharisto,
telling him, that enough it was for hir to haue escaped that present
peryl, from which he like a princely Gentleman had deliuered hir, and
therefore duering hir life was most bounde vnto him. Philon greately
wondred at the goodnesse of this Ladie: howbeit the ingratitude of that
Varlet by no meanes he would suffer to bee vnpunished. And beeing
aduertised that Acharisto remayned in hys Palace without any suspicion
of this aduenture, banded neyther with Guarde or other assurance,
committed Euphimia to safe custodie, and sodainly assailed the Palace of
Acharisto: and finding the Gates open, he entred the city, crying out
vpon the Wickednesse and treason of Acharisto. At which wordes the whole
City began to ryse, to helpe Philon in his enterpryse: for there was no
state or degree, but abhorred the vnkind order of that Varlet, towards
the noble woman their Queene. Philon aided with the people, assaulted
the Palace, and in short space inuaded the same: and the Varlet beeing
apprehended, was put to death. The Corinthians seeing the noble mind of
Philon, and the loue which he bare to Euphimia, and knowing that their
late Kyng was disposed to haue matched her wyth Philon, were very
willing to haue him to be their Kinge, and that Euphimia should be his
wife, supposinge that vnder the gouernement of a Prynce so gentle and
valiant, they might liue very happily and ioyefullye. Execution don vpon
that moste vnkinde varlet, Philon caused the Lady to be conueyed home
into hir royal pallace: and the people with humble submission, began to
persuade hir to marie wyth that younge Prince Philon. But shee which had
lodged hir thoughts and fixed hir mind vpon that caytife, who
vnnaturally had abused hir, would by no meanes consent to take a new
husband, saying, that the seconde mariage was not to bee allowed in any
woman. And albeit that shee
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page336" id = "page336">336</a></span>
knewe howe greately she was bounde to Philon, as duringe life not able
to recompence his louing kindnesse and valyante exployte performed for
hir safegard, yet for al hir vnhappy fortune, shee was minded styll to
remayne a widowe, and well contented that Philon shoulde possesse hir
whole domynion and kingdome, and she pleased to lyue his subiecte: which
state she sayd, did like her best. Philon, that not for desire of the
Kingdome, but for loue of the Lady had attempted that worthy and
honourable enterprise, sayd vnto hir: “Euphimia, it was onely for youre
sake that I aduentured thys daungerous indeuor, to ridde you from the
slander that might haue ensued your innocent death, and out of the cruel
hands of hym, whom vnworthily you did so dearely loue. No desyre of
kyngdome or worldly glorye induced me herevnto: no care that I had to
enlarge the boundes of my countrey soile pricked the courage of my mynd
(that is altogether empty of ambytion) but the Passion of carelesse
Loue, whych thys long tyme I haue borne you in your happy father’s
dayes, to whom I made incessant sute: and to your selfe I was so long a
Suter, vntyll I receyued extreame repulse: for which I vowed a
perpetuall single Lyfe, vntyll thys occasyon was offred: the brute
whereof when I hearde first, so stirred the mynde of your most louyng
knight, that drousie sleepe or greedy hunger, coulde not force this
restlesse body to tarry at home, vntyl I reuenged my selfe vpon that
villaine borne, which went about wyth roasting flames to consume the
innocente flesh of hir whome I loued best. And therfore mustred together
my men of armes and in secret sort imbarked our selues and arryued here:
where wee haue accomplished the thyng we came for and haue settled you
in quiet raygne, free from peryl of traiterous mindes, crauing for thys
my fact nought else of you but wylling mynd to be my wife: which sith
you do refuse, I&nbsp;passe not for rule of your kyngdom, ne yet for
abode in Corinth, but meane to leaue you to your choyse. For satisfied
am I, that I haue manifested to the world the greatnesse of my loue,
which was so ample as euer king could beare to vertuous Queene: and so
farewell.” At which words he made a signe to his people, that they
shoulde shippe them selues for return to Peloponesus. But the Senatours
and al the people of Corinth seing the curtesie of Philon,

and how greatly their Queene was bound vnto him, fel downe vpon their
knees, and with ioyned hands besought hir to take him to husbande, neuer
ceasing from teares and supplication, vntyl she had consented to their
requeste. Then the mariage was solempnised with great ioy and triumph,
and the whole City after that tyme, lyued in great felicity and quiet,
so long as nature lengthned the dayes of those two Noble Prynces.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">Good</span> Euphimia (as you haue harde)
did fondly apply hir loue vpon a seruile man, who though bred vp in
court where trayninge and vse doth alter the rude conditions of sutch as
be intertayned there, yet voyde of all gentlenesse, and frustrate of
Nature’s sweetenesse in that curteous kinde, as not exchaunginge natiue
fiercenesse for noble aduauncement, returned to hys hoggish soyle, and
walowed in the durty filth of Inhumanity, <i>whose nature myght wel with
fork, or staffe be expelled, but home againe it would haue come</i>, as
Horace pleadeth in his Epistles. O&nbsp;noble Gentlewoman, that mildly
suffred the displeasure of the good king hir father, who would fayne
haue dissuaded hir from that vnseemely match, to ioyne with a yong
Prince, a&nbsp;king, a&nbsp;Gentleman of great perfection: and O
pestilent Carle, being beloued of so honourable a pucell, that for
treason discharged thy head from the block, and of a donghill slaue
preferred thee to be a king, wouldest for those deserts in the ende
frame sayned matter to consume hir. With iust hatred then did the Noble
Emperour Claudius Cæsar prosecute those of bond and seruile kinde that
were matched with the free and noble. Right well knew hee that some
taste of egrenesse would rest in sutch sauage fruite, and therefore made
a law, that the issue of them should not haue like liberty and
preheminence, as other had, which agreeably did couple. What harme sutch
mariage hath deferred to diuers states and persons (t’auoide other
examples) the former Nouell teacheth. Wherfore to ende the same, with
bewailing of Euphimia for hir vnluckie lot, begin we now to glad our
selues with the wise and stoute aunswer of a chaste Marquesse,
a&nbsp;Gentlewoman of singular beauty and discretion, made to the fond
demaund of a mighty Monarch, that fondly fell in loue with hir, and made
a reckening of that, which was doubtfull to recouer. This king by Louing
Hir whome he neuer saw,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page339" id = "page339">339</a></span>
fared like the man that in his slepe dreamed that he had in holde the
thynge furthest from him. For the King neuer saw hir, before he heard
hir praised, and when hee hearde hir praised, for purpose to winne her,
he trauailed oute of his way, so sure to enioy hir, as if he had neuer
seene hir. This historie, although briefe, yet sheweth light to noble
dames that be pursued by Prynces, and teacheth them wyth what regarde
they ought to interteine such suters. The Marquesse then of Monferrato,
a&nbsp;citye in Italy, beynge a Gentleman of great prowesse and
valiance, was appointed to transfrete the Seas in a generall passage
made by the Christians, wyth an huge Armie and great furniture. And as
it chaunced, vpon a day greate talke was had in the court of king Philip
surnamed Luscus (bicause he was poreblinde) who likewyse was making
preparation to depart out of Fraunce in the said iorney. Report was made
by a knight which knewe the said Marquize, that in all the world there
was not the like maried couple, as the Marquize and his wyfe were, as
well bicause the Marquize was bruted to be an excellent gentleman, as
also for that his wyfe amonges al the troupe of Ladies, that liued in
the world that time, was the fairest and most vertuous. Which words so
entred the French king’s head, as sodainely (neuer seeing hir in all his
life) he began to loue hir, and for that purpose determined to imbarke
him selfe at Genoua, that by trauailyng that way by lande, he myght haue
good occasion to see the Marchionisse, thinking that her husband being
absent, hee might easily obtein that he desired. And as he had deuised,
he began his enterpryse: who sending al his power before, toke his
iorney wyth a meane trayne of Gentlemen: and beynge within one Daye’s
iourney of the Ladye’s House, hee sent hir worde that the nexte Daye hee
would visite her at Dynner. The sage and discrete lady ioyfully
aunswered the Messanger, that she would accompt his comming for a great
and singuler pleasure, and sayd that hys grace should be most heartily
welcome. Afterwards she maruelled why sutch a king as he was, would in
hir husband’s absence, come to hir house: and in that maruel and
consideration she was no whit deceyued, coniecturinge that the fame of
hir beauty was the cause of hys comminge. Neuerthelesse, like a wise
Lady and honest gentlewoman, she
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page340" id = "page340">340</a></span>
determined to do him honour, and caused the worshipfull of hir country
sutch as remayned behinde, to be assembled, for aduice in all thinges
that were necessary for hys intertaynement. But the feast and variety of
meats that should be serued, she alone tooke vppon hir to dispose and
order: wherefore speedily sendinge about, and makinge prouision for all
the Hennes that might be gotten throughout the countrey, commaunded hir
cookes, of those Hennes without other thing what so euer, to prepare
diuers seruices. The king fayled not the next day to come accordingly as
he had sent word: and was with great honour receyued of the Lady, and in
beholdinge hir, she seemed vnto hym (besides hys imagination
comprehended by the former woordes of the Knyght) to be farre more
faire, honest and vertuous, than hee thought, attributyng vnto hir,
singular prayse and commendation. And so much the more his desire was
kindled, as she passed the estimation bruted of hir. And after that the
King had wythdrawen him selfe into the chamber ordeined and made ready
for him, as appertained to a Prynce so greate, and that dinner time was
come, the King and Madame the Marchionisse sat together at one boorde,
and other accordyng to their degrees were placed at seueral tables. The
King serued with many Dishes and excellent Wynes, beholdinge sometymes
the Lady Marchionesse, conceyued great delight and pleasure. But vewing
the seruice, and meates (although dressed in diuers sortes) to be but
Hennes, he began to wonder, specially knowing the soyle wherein they
were to be so rich and plentifull, as by little trauayle, great
abundance of Foule and Venison might haue bin prouided, and thought that
she had indifferent leysure to Chase and Hunt, after that he had sent
hir woorde of hys comminge. Notwythstandinge he would not take occasion
to enter into talke of those wants of better Cheare (hir Hennes only
excepted) who lookyng vpon hir, with mery Countenaunce hee sayde vnto
hir: “Madame were all these Hennes bred in thys countrey wythout a
Cock?” The Marchionisse which full well vnderstoode the cause of his
demaunde, thinkinge that God had sent hir an apt tyme for aunswere as
she desired, boldly aunswered the Kinge: “No and it please your grace,
but of Women, albeit in honour and apparell there is some difference,
yet they be al made in this Countrey
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page341" id = "page341">341</a></span>
as they be else where.” The kyng hearing hir aunswere, right wel did
know the occasion of the Banket of Hennes, and whereunto hir wordes did
tend: and considred that to bestow any further talke to so wyse a Lady,
it were in vayne, and that force there could take no place. Lyke as
vnaduisedly he fell in loue, so it behoued him of necessity wysely to
staunch the fire for his honour sake, and wythout any more taunting
wordes, fearing hir reuenge, he dined without hope to get other thinge
of hir. And when hee had done, to the intent by hys sodayne departure,
he might couer his dishonest comming, thankinge hir for the honour which
he had receyued, and she recommending him to God, he departed to Genoua.
Here may be proued the great difference betweene Wysedome and Folly,
betweene Vertue and Vice. The King more by Lust, than other desire, by
circumstances endeuoured to sound the deapth of the Ladie’s minde: she
by comely answere, payd hym home for his folly. A&nbsp;liuely

<p>Wherfore let euery wight beware how they gage their honesty for any
enterprise (seeme it neuer so impossible). Maistresse Dianora deerely
beloued of a gentleman, and earnestly assayled, in the ende yelded vpon
a condition: which if it could be brought to passe (which she thought
impossible) was content to surrender to his loue: who consulting with a
Magitian, performed hir request: then what folowed, and what counsel hir
husband gaue hir, after she had broken the effect of hir promise to hym,
and what Curtesie was vsed on all sides, the sequele hereof dyscloseth.
The Countrey of Frioli although it be colde, yet is it pleasaunt by
reason of many faire mountaines, riuers, and cleere sprynges that are in
the same: where there is a City called Vdina, and in the same sometime
dwellyng a faire gentlewoman called Mistresse Dianora, the wyfe of
Gilberto, a&nbsp;notable rich man, a&nbsp;very curteous personage, and
of good behauiour. This Lady, for hir graces and vertues, was intierly
beloued of a Gentleman and great Lord, called maister Ansaldo Grandese,
who for his liberalyty and valyance in armes, was famous and well
knowen: and albeit that hee loued hir feruently, seking al meanes
possible to be beloued of hir, soliciting hir many tymes by
Ambassadours, yet his labour was in vayn. And the Lady being offended
for hys dayly sute and trauayle, hee for al hir refusal and disagreement
to his desire, would not abstaine from louing hir, but still mayntayne
his importunate sute: she deuising with her selfe how to rid him away,
made a request vnto him, so straunge and impossible, (in&nbsp;hir
iudgement) as he was not able to bring the same to passe: and vpon a day
she sayd vnto an old woman, (the which cam often tymes to sue vnto hir
in hys behalf) these words: “Good wife, thou hast many times assured me,
that Maister Ansaldo doth loue mee aboue all other, and thou hast
offered vnto me maruellous giftes and presents in hys name: al which I
haue refused, vpon consideration,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page344" id = "page344">344</a></span>
that I mynd not to fauour or loue him for his goods: but if thou canst
iustify by warrantize or other probable argument, that hee loueth me so
mutch as thou sayest, I&nbsp;will condescend without fayle to loue him
againe and to doe the thing that it shal please him to commaund me:
therfore if he wil assure me to do that thing which I shal require hym
to do, tel him that I am at his commaundement.” “What is that madame,”
(said the old woman) “that you desire?” “The thing which I demaund”
(answered the Gentlewoman) “is, that he should cause to be made here
without the Citie, during the moneth of Januarie next commyng,
a&nbsp;garden full of greene herbes, floures and trees, bespred wyth
leaues, euen as it were in the moneth of May: and if so be that he do it
not, then let him neuer send thee or any other vnto me agayn: for if
afterwards he be importunate vpon me, like as I haue hitherto kept it
close from my husbande and parents, euen so complayning vnto them,
I&nbsp;wyll assaye to bee dispatched from hys long and tedious sute.”
When the knight vnderstoode that request, and the offer that hys
Mystresse made him (although it seemed a thinge very difficulte and all
most impossible to bee done) knowinge very well that she did the same
for none other purpose, but onely to put him out of hope that euer hee
should enioy hir, hee determined notwithstandinge, to proue what hee was
able to do. And for that purpose sent to seeke in many places of the
Worlde if there were any man that could assist him and geue him Counsel
therin. In the ende there was one found that offred to doe it
(if&nbsp;he were well waged thereunto) by the art of Necromancie, with
whom maister Ansaldo bargained for a great summe of Money. Then he
expected the moneth of Ianuarie with great deuotion, whych beeing come,
euen when the coldest wether was, and that al places were ful of snow
and yce, this Necromancer vsed his art in sutch sort, as in the night
after the holy dais of Christmasse, in a faire medow adioyning to the
city, ther appered in the morning (as&nbsp;they can testify that saw the
same) one of the fairest gardens that euer any man saw, full of herbes,
trees, and fruites of all sortes: which when maister Ansaldo had seen,
God knoweth if he were glad or not: and incontinently caused to be
gathered the fairest fruites and floures that were there, and secretlye
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page345" id = "page345">345</a></span>
sente the same to his Friende, inuiting hir to come and see the Garden
which she had procured him to make, to the intent thereby she might know
the loue that he bare hir, and to remember the promise which she made
him, and confirmed by othe, that he might from that time forth esteeme
hir a woman so good as hir promise. When the Gentlewoman sawe the
flowers and fruictes and hearing tell by report of the straunge things
that were in that Garden, began to repent hir selfe of the promise which
shee had made: but for all her repentaunce, she like one desirous to se
straung things, wente wyth many other women to see the same: and hauing
praised it, not wythout greate admiration, she returned home, the
angriest woman that euer was, when she had considered in what sort she
had abused hir selfe by meanes of that Garden: and hir rage was so
greate, that she could by no meanes keepe the same so secrete or close,
but that her husband muste perceiue the same, who woulde needes knowe of
hir al the whole matter: the Gentlewoman a long time kepte it secrete:
in the ende she was constrained to declare vnto him the same in order.
Hir husbande hearing what she had promised was sodainly very angry:
afterwardes considering the pure intente of his wife, hee wisely
appeaseed hir, and sayd: “Dianora, it is not the acte of a wyse and
vertuouse wife to encline hir eare to sutch messages as those be, and
lesse honest to make any marte or bargain of hir honesty with any
person, vnder what condicion soeuer it be. Words which the hart
receiueth by the eares, haue greater force than many do esteme, and
there is nothing so difficult, but by the amorous is brought to passe.
First therfore thou hast done euil to giue eare vnto such ambassage, and
afterwards for agreement to the bargaine: for the weight of chastity is
so ponderous, as by no meanes it ought to be laid in balance, eyther by
impossibilities to boast and bragge therof, or else by assurance of
their conceiued thought to bring it into question, leaste in all places
the same may be dysputed vpon, and blemysh with the note of lightnesse,
the person tyll that time vnspotted: but bycause I know the purity of
thy heart, I&nbsp;wyll agree vnto thee for discharge of thy promise,
whych peraduenture, some other would not doe, moued therunto for the
feare I haue of the Necromancer, who if he see Mayster
<span class = "pagenum">

Ansaldo to be offended bicause thou hast deluded hym, may doe vs some
displeasure: wherfore I wyll that thou go to maister Ansaldo, and if
thou canest by any meanes to vse thy selfe (as&nbsp;thyne honour saued)
thou mayst discharge thy promise, I&nbsp;shall commende thy wit: but if
there be no remedye otherwyse, for that onely time then lende forth thy
Body and not thy wyll.” The gentlewoman hearyng hir husband so wisely
speake, could doe nought else but weepe, and sayd, that she would not
agree to his requeste. Notwythstanding, it pleased the husband (for al
the denial whych his wife did make) that it shoulde be so: by meanes
wherof, the next morning vpon the point of day the Gentlewoman in the
homliest attire she had, with two of hir seruantes before, and hir mayde
behinde, wente to the lodging of maister Ansaldo, who when he hearde
tell that hys Louer was come to see hym, maruelled mutch, and rising vp,
called the Necromancer, and sayde vnto him: “My wyll is, that thou see
how mutch thyne arte hath preuailed:” and going vnto hir, without any
disordinate lust, he saluted hir wyth reuerence, and honestly receiued
hir. Then they entred into a faire Chamber, and sittyng downe before a
great fire, he sayde vnto hir these Wordes: “Madame, I&nbsp;humbly
beseeche you, if the loue which I haue borne you of long time, and yet
doe beare, deserue some recompence, that it please you to tell me
vnfainedly the cause which haue made you to come hither thus early, and
with such a company.” The shamefast Gentlewoman, hir eyes ful of teares,
made answere: “Sir, the loue which I beare you, nor any promised faith
haue brought me hither, but rather the only commaundement of my husband,
who hath greater respect to the payne and trauaile of your disordinate
loue, than to his own honour or my reputation, who hath caused me to
come hither, and by hys commaundement am redy for this once to satisfie
your pleasure.” If Mayster Ansaldo were abashed at the begynnyng, be
much more did maruell when he hearde the Gentlewoman thus to speake, and
moued with the liberality of hir husband, he began to chaunge his heate
into compassion, and said: “Mistresse, God defend if it be true that you
do say, that I should soyle the honour of hym, whych hath pity vpon my
loue, and therefore you may tarrie here so long as it shall please you,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page347" id = "page347">347</a></span>
with sutch assurance of your honesty as if you were my naturall sister,
and frankly may depart when you be disposed, vpon sutch condicion, that
you render in my behalf those thanks vnto your husband which you shal
thinke conuenient, for the great liberality whych he hath imployed vpon
me, deeming my selfe henceforth so much bound vnto him, as if I were his
brother or Seruaunt.” The Gentlewoman hearing those wordes, the best
contented that euer was, sayd vnto him: “All the worlde could neuer make
me beleue (your great honesty considered) that other thing could happen
vnto mee by my commyng hyther, than that which presently I see: for
which I recken my selfe perpetually bounde vnto you.” And takynge hir
leaue, honorablye returned in the aforesayde company home to hir
husband, and tolde hym what had chaunced, which engendred perfect loue
and amytye betweene hym and mayster Ansaldo. The Necromancer to whom
maister Ansaldo determined to gyue the price, couenanted betwene them,
seyng the liberality which the husbande had vsed towards mayster
Ansaldo, and the like of mayster Ansaldo towards the Gentlewoman, sayd:
“God defend, that sith I haue seene the husband lyberall of his honour,
and you bountiful of your loue and curtesie, but that I be likewyse
franke in my reward: for knowing that it is well employed of you,
I&nbsp;purpose that you shall keepe it still.” The knyghte was ashamed,
and would haue forced him to take the whole, or part: but in offryng the
same, he lost his laboure: and the Necromancer the third day after,
hauying vndon his Garden, and desirous to departe, tooke his leaue. Thus
Ansaldo extinguishing the dishonest loue kindled in hys hearte, for
inioying of his Lady, vpon consideration of honest charity, and regard
of Curtesie, repressed his wanton minde, and absteyned from that which
God graunte that others by lik Example may refrayne.</p>

his practise, this example at large discourseth. Very true it is
(at&nbsp;least wyse if credite may bee gieuen to the words of certayne
Genoua Merchauntes, and of others whych haue trauayled that

countrey) how in Cataya, there was sometimes a rich Gentleman without
comparison, named Nathan, who hauing a place or Pallace ioyning vpon the
high way, by which the trauaylers to and from the West, and East, were
constrayned to passe, and hauing a noble and liberal heart, desirous by
experience to haue the same to be knowen, and wyth what nature and
quality it was affected, he assembled dyuers maister Masons and
Carpenters, and in short tyme erected there one of the stateliest
Pallaces for greatnesse and costly furniture that euer was seene in that
countrey, which afterwards he caused to be stored with all things
necessary, honourably to entertayne ech Gentleman that passed that way:
and with a great trayne of seruantes he welcomed and accepted sutch as
iourneyed to and fro. And in this commendable custome he perseuered so
longe as both in the East and West partes, report was bruted of his
renoume and fame: and being come to auncient yeares, not for all that
weary of his liberality, it chaunced that his fame flewe to the eares of
a yong gentleman called Mithridanes, who in a country not farre of from
his, had his abode and resiance. Mithridanes knowing himselfe to be so
rich as Nathan, enuious of his vertue and liberality, purposed by some
meanes or other to defame and obscure his neyghbour’s good reporte: and
hauing builded a Palace like to that which Nathan did possesse, began to
vse curtesies to those which passed to and fro, in outragious and
disordred sort: whereby in little time he purchased great fame. Now it
chaunced vpon a day, as Mithridanes was alone in the court of his
Palace, a&nbsp;poore woman entring in at one of the gates of the same,
craued almes, and had it and so successiuely euen to the twelfth and
thirtenth time, also she retorned agayne, which Mithridanes perceiuing,
said vnto her: “Good wyfe you come hither very often:” and yet he denied
not hir almes. The old woman hearing those words, sayd: “O&nbsp;how
maruellous is the liberality of Nathan, whose palace hath <span class =
"smallroman">XXXII.</span> entries by seuerall gates, so greate as this,
and daily begging almes there, neuer made semblance as though he knew
me, and yet the same was not denied me: and being come hither but <span
class = "smallroman">XIII.</span> times, I&nbsp;haue bene marked and
reproued:” and saying so, she went her way, and neuer after came thither
agayne. Mithridanes hearyng these
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page350" id = "page350">350</a></span>
wordes to proceede from the old woman fell into a great rage, deeming
the fame reported of Nathan to be a diminution of his own, and said: “Ah
wretch, when shal I be able to attayne the liberality of Nathan’s
greatest things? and why then goe I about to excel him, when in litle
matters I am not able to come neare him? verily I labour all in vaine,
if I myselfe do not seeke meanes to rid him of his life, sith croked age
is not disposed to dispatch him, I&nbsp;must therfore doe the same with
myne own hands.<ins class = "addition" title =
"close quote missing">”</ins>
And in that fury makyng no man priuy to his intent, he
rode forth with a smal traine, and in three dayes arriued where Nathan
dwelte, and then commaunded his men in any wise not to be knowen that
they came with him, and likewise that they knewe him not, but to prouide
lodging for themselues, vntyll sutch tyme as they had further newes from
him. Mithridanes then being arriued about evening, al alone, found
Nathan walking vp and downe before his faire Palace, without other
company than himself, who in simple attire and garment went forth to
meete him: of whom Mithridanes, bicause he knew not Nathan, demaunded if
he could tell him where Nathan dwelt. Nathan pleasantly made him answer:
“My sonne, ther is no man in these quarters that can better tel thee
than I, and therfore yf thou please, I&nbsp;wyll bring thee thither.”
Mithridanes said, that he should doe hym a very great pleasure: but he
would not if it were possible bee seene or knowen of Nathan: “And that
can I very wel do,” said Nathan, now that I know your mynd. Being then
lighted of from his horse, he went with Nathan, who by and by
interteined him with diuersity of talk, to his faire Palace: and Nathan
incontinently caused one of his seruaunts to take Mithridanes’ horse,
and said vnto him in hys eare that he should wyth all speede giue order
to his housholde, that none should tel the younge Man that he was
Nathan, which accordingly was done: but after they were in the Palace,
Nathan brought Mithridanes into a very fayre chambre, that none mighte
see him excepte sutch as he had appoynted to serue hym: and causinge
greate honour to bee done vnto him, hee hymselfe kepte him company. As
they two were together, Mithridanes asked him (to&nbsp;whom hee vsed
conuenable reuerence as to his father) what he was? whom Nathan
answered: “I&nbsp;am one of Nathan’s pore seruaunts, that
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page351" id = "page351">351</a></span>
from the time of my youth haue bene broughte vp wyth him, and neuer
aduaunced me to any thing but to that which you see: wherefore, although
euery man greatly prayseth him, yet haue I no cause to commend hym.”
These wordes gaue some hope to Mithridanes, by better aduise and surety
to execute his wicked intente: and Nathan asked him very curteously what
he was, and for what businesse he was come thither, offeryng him helpe
and counsel in that he was able to do. Mithridanes then paused a while
before he would make him answere: and in the ende purposyng to put his
trust in him, required with great circumstance of wordes his fayth and
after that his counsell and ayde. Then he wholy discouered what he was,
wherefore he was come, and the cause that moued hym. Nathan hearing
those woordes, and the mischieuous determination of Mithridanes, was
chaunged and troubled in mynde, notwythstandyng wythout making any
semblaunce of displeasure answered him with bolde countenaunce:
“Mithridanes, thy father was a Gentleman, and of stoute stomacke, from
whome so farre as I see, thou wylt not degenerate, by attemptyng so
great an enterpryse as thou hast done. I&nbsp;intende to be lyberall to
ech man and praise greatly the Enuye whych thou bearest to the Vertue of
Nathan, bycause if there were many sutch, the Worlde which is now
myserable, would shortly become prosperous and happye: and doe make thee
promyse, that the intent thou goest about, shall be kepte secrete,
whereunto I can sooner gyue Counsell than any great helpe, and mine
aduyse is this: you may see from the place where we now be a lyttle
Groaue, about a quarter of a Myle hence, whereunto Nathan in a maner
walketh euery mornyng, and tarrieth there a long time: there you may
easily finde him, and do your pleasure: and if you kyll him, you may
goe, (to&nbsp;the intent without daunger you may returne home to your
owne House) not that way you came, but by that you see on the lefte hand
leade out of the wod, whych although it be not so common as the other,
yet is the nearest way and safest for you to passe.” When Mithridanes
was thus informed, and that Nathan departed from him, he caused worde
secretly to be sent to his Men, which likewyse lodged there, in what
place they should waight for him the next day: and when the day was com,
Nathan not altering the counsel he gaue to Mithridanes,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page352" id = "page352">352</a></span>
ne chaunging any part of the same, went all alone into the little
woodde, to receiue his Death. When Mithridanes was vp, and had taken his
bowe and sword, (for he had none other weapons) he mounted vpon his
horse, and rode to the little woodde, where a farre of he espied Nathan,
commyng thitherward all alone, and determining before he would set vppon
him to see him and heare him speake, made toward him, and catchyng him
by the band vpon his head, said vnto him: “Old chorle thou art dead.”
<ins class = "notation" title = "printed ‘Wher-/vnto’ at line break">Whervnto</ins>
Nathan made none other answer, but said,
“I&nbsp;haue deserued it.” When Mithridanes heard his voyce and looked
him in the face, he knew by and by that it was he which had curteously
receiued him, familiarly kept him company, and faithfully had gyuen him
counsel. Wherupon, his fury asswaged, and his anger conuerted to shame:
by meanes whereof, throwing downe his sworde which he had drawn to
strike him, he lighted of from his horse, and did prostrate himselfe at
Nathan his father’s feete, and said vnto him weeping: “I&nbsp;manifestly
perceiue right louing father your great lyberality, and by what pollicy
you be come hyther to render to me your lyfe: whereunto I hauyng no
ryght, declared my selfe desyrous to haue the same: but our Lord God,
more carefull of my deuoir than my self, hath euen at the very point,
when it was moste needefull, opened the eyes of myne vnderstandynge,
which curssed spite and cancred enuy haue closed vp: and therefore, the
more you were ready to gratify my desire, the greater punishment I
knowledge my selfe to deserue for my faulte. Take then of me if it
please you sutch vengance as you thynke meete for myne offence.” Nathan
caused Mithridanes to rise vp, kissinge and imbracinge hym tenderly, and
sayd vnto hym: “My sonne, thou needest not to demaund pardon, for the
enterprise done, good or euill as thou list to name it: for thou diddest
not go about to rid me of my lyfe for any hatred thou diddest bear me,
but only to be accompted the better: be assured then of me, and verily
beleue, that there is no lyuing man, that I loue better than thy self,
considering the greatnesse of thine heart not inclyned to hoorde or
gather togither the drossy muck of Syluer, as the myserable do, but to
spend that which is gathered. Be not ashamed for hauing a will to kill
me, thereby to great

renowme: for Emperours and greatest kings, neuer streatched forth their
power, and racked their Realmes, and consequently aspired fam, for other
purpose but to kyl: not by murdering one man as thou didst meane, but of
infinit numbers, besides the burning of Countries, and rasing of Cities:
wherefore if to make thy selfe more famous, thou wouldest have killed me
alone, thyne enterprise was not newly to be wondred at, but a thyng in
dayly practise.” Mithridanes no more excusinge hys wicked intent, but
praysinge the honest excuse, which Nathan had deuised, drew neare vnto
hym to enter into further talke wyth hym, which was, how he greatly
maruelled, that he durst approch the place, with so litle rescue, where
his death was sworne, and what he meant him selfe to tell the way and
meanes: wherein he required him to say his mynde, for disclosinge of the
cause. Whereunto Nathan replied: “Maruell not, Mithridanes, of mine
intent and purpose, for sithens I was at age disposed to myne owne free
will, and determined to do that which thou hast gone about to do, neuer
any came to me, but I haue contented them (so&nbsp;farre as I was hable)
of that they did demaund: thou art come hither with desire to haue my
lyfe, wherefore seeing that thou diddest craue, I&nbsp;forthwith dyd
meane to gieue it, that thou alone mightest not be the man that should
depart from hence without atchieuing thy request: and to bring to passe
that thou myghtest haue the same, I&nbsp;gaue thee the best Counsel I
could, aswel for bereuing of my lyfe, as for enioyinge of thyne owne:
and therefore I say to thee agayne, and pray thee for to take it,
thereby to content thy selfe, if thou haue any pleasure therein: for I
do not know whych way better to imploy it. I&nbsp;haue all ready kept it
foure score yeares, and haue consumed the same in pleasures, and
delights, and do know by course of nature in other men, and generally in
all things, that long it cannot reast in breathing dayes: wherefore I
think good, that better it is to geue, as I haue dayly done, and departe
with my Treasures, than keepe it till nature cary it away in despite of
my Teeth, and maugre that I haue. It is a little gift to giue one
hundred yeares, how mutch lesse is it then to giue sixe or eyght of
those I haue to liue? Take it then if it please thee, I&nbsp;thee
beseech: for neuer yet found I man that did desire the same, ne yet do
know when I
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page354" id = "page354">354</a></span>
shall finde sutch one, if that thy selfe which didst desire it, do not
take it: and if it chaunce that I do finde some one, I&nbsp;know full
well that so mutch the longer as I shall keepe the same the lesse
esteemed it shall be, and therefore before the same be vile and of
little price, take it I beseech thee.” Mithridanes sore ashamed, sayd:
“God forbid, that by separating so deare a thing as is thy life, that I
should take it, or onely desire the same, as I did erst, from which I
would not diminish yeares, but willingly would of myne owne ad thereto
if I could.” Whereunto Nathan by and by replyed: “And if thou couldest,
wouldest thou gieue them? and wouldest thou cause me do to thee that
which I neuer did to any man, that is to say, to take of thy things
which neuer I did of any liuing person?” “Yea verily,” aunswered
Mithridanes. “Then,” sayde Nathan: “thou oughtest there to doe that
which I wyll tel thee: which is to remayne here in my house so younge as
thou art, and beare the name of Nathan, and I would goe to thine, and
bee called Mithridanes.” Then Mithridanes answered: “If I had also so
great experience as thou hast, I&nbsp;woulde not refuse thine offer, but
bicause I am assured, that my deedes woulde diminish the renoume of
Nathan, I&nbsp;wyll not marre that in another, which I cannot redresse
in my selfe: and therefore I wyll not take it.” After thys talke, and a
great deale more betwene them, they repayred to the Palace, vppon the
request of Nathan, where many dayes he did great honour to Mithridanes,
incoraging and counselling him, so wel as he could, dayly to perseuere
in his high and great indeuour. And Mithridanes desirous to returne home
with his company, Nathan (after that he had let him well to know, that
he was not able to surpasse him in liberality) gaue him leaue.</p>

Mayster Gentil of Carisendi being come from Modena, tooke a woman out of

brought forth a Sonne, which mayster Gentil rendred afterwardes with the
mother to mayster Nicholas Chasennemie her husband.</p>


<p><span class = "firstword">Reading</span> this History, I consider two
straung and rare chaunces: the one a lyberall and courteous act of an
earnest louer towards his beloued and hir husband, in leauinge hir
vntouched, and not dishonored, although in full puissance to doe his
pleasure: the other a lyke liberall offre by presentinge whom he dearly
loued, and a newe borne Chylde: both supposed to be dead by hir
freendes, and therefore Intoumbed in Graue. Wherewithall is to bee noted
the rare and singuler desire of a gentlewoman, by humble sute for
conseruation of her honour, although longe time pursued by a Gentleman
that reuiued hir almost from death, and thought her vtterly to be void
of life. To praise the one, and to leaue the other not magnified, it
were a part of discurtesy: but to extol both with shoutes, and
acclamations of infinite praise no dout but very commendable. If
comparisons may be made with Prynces of elder yeares, and not to note
those of later, truely Mayster Gentil by that hys fact, seemeth not
mutch inferior to Scipio Africanus for sparing the wyfe of Indibilis, ne
yet to king Cyrus for Panthea the wyfe of Abradatus: although both of
them not in equall state of loue, (as&nbsp;wholly estraunged from that
passion) like to maister Gentil, who in deed for subduing that griefe
and motion, deserueth greater prayse. For sooner is that torment auoyded
at the first assault and pinch, than when it is suffred long to flame
and raigne in that yelding portion of man, the heart, which once fed
with the bayt of loue, is seldome or neuer loosed. To do at large to
vnderstand the proofe of those most vertuous persons, thus beginneth the
history. At Bologna a very notable Citty of Lombardy, there was a Knyght
of very great respect for his vertue, named maister Gentil Carissendi,
who in his youth fell
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page356" id = "page356">356</a></span>
in loue with a Gentlewoman called maistresse Katherine, the wyfe of one
mayster Nicholas Chassennemie. And bicause during that loue he receiued
a very ill counterchange for his affection that he bare vnto hir, he
went away (like one desperate) to be the iudge and potestate of Modena,
whereunto he was called. About the time that hir husband being out of
Bologna, and the gentlewoman at hir Manour in the countrey, not past a
mile and a halfe from the Citty, (whither she went to remayne, bicause
she was with childe) it chaunced that she was sodenly surprised with a
sicknesse, which was of so great force, as there was no token of lyfe in
her, but rather iudged by all Phisitians to be a dead Woman. And because
that hir neerest Kinne reported that they hearde hir saye, that shee
could not bee longe time with Childe, but that the infante must be
perfect in her wombe and ready to be deliuered, and therefore affected
wyth some other disease and griefe that would bring hir to hir ende, as
a Timpany or other swelling, rising of grosse humors, they thought hir a
dead Woman, and past recouery: wherefore vpon a time she falling into a
traunce, was verily supposed to be dead. Who after they had mourned hir
death, and bewayled the sodayn expiration of hir soule, caused hir to be
buried without hope of recouery (euen as she was in that extasie) in a
graue of a church adioyning harde by the house wher she dwelt. Which
thing incontinently was aduertised master Gentil by one of his frends,
who although he was not likely, as he thought, to attayne hir fauor and
in vtter dispayre therof, yet it gryeued him very mutch that no better
heede was taken vnto hir, thynking by diligence and time shee woulde
haue reuyued agayn, sayinge thus in the end vnto him selfe: “How now
madam Katherin, that Death hath wrought his wyll wyth you, and I could
neuer obteyne durynge your life one simple looke from those youre
glistering eies, which lately I beheld to my great ouerthrow and decay,
wherfore now when you cannot defend your self, I&nbsp;may bee bold (you
being dead) to steale from you some desired kisse.” When hee had sayd
so, beyng already Nyght, and hauynge taken order that none should know
of his departure, he gat vpon his Horse, accompanied with one only
seruaunt, and wythout taryinge anye where, arriued at the place where
his Lady was buryed, and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page357" id = "page357">357</a></span>
opening the Graue, forthwith he entred in, and laying himself downe
besides hir, he approched neare hir face, and many times kissed hir,
pouryng forthe great abundance of teares. But as we see the appetyte of
Man not to be content excepte it proceede further (specially of sutch as
bee in loue) beyng determined to tarrye no longer there, and to departe,
he sayd: “Ah God, why should I goe no further, why should I not touche
hir, why should I not proue whyther she be alyue or dead?” Vanquished
then wyth that motyon, hee felt hir brests, and holding his hand there
for a certayne tyme, perceyued hir Heart as it were to pant, and thereby
some lyfe remayning in hir: wherefore so softly as he could, wyth the
helpe of his man, he raised hir out of the graue: and settynge hir vppon
his Horse before him, secretly caried hir home to his house at Bologna.
The mother of maister Gentil dwelled there, which was a graue and
vertuous Matrone, who vnderstandyng by her sonne the whole effect of
that chaunce, moued wyth compassion, vnknowne to anye man, placing hir
before a great fire, and comfortyng hir wyth a bathe prepared for the
purpose, she recouered lyfe in the Gentlewoman that was supposed to bee
deade, who so soone as she was com to hir self, threw forth a great sigh
and sayd: “Alas, wher am I now?” To whom the good old woman sayd: “Be of
good cheere swete hart, yee bee in a good place.” The Gentlewoman hauing
wholly recouered hir senses, and looking round about hir, not yet well
knowing where she was, and seing maister Gentill before hir, prayed his
mother to tell hir how she came thither. To whome maister Gentil
declared in order what he had done for hir, and what meanes he vsed to
bryng hir thyther: wherof makyng hir complaynt, and lamentyng the lyttle
regard and neglygence of hir frends, she rendred vnto hym inumerable
thankes. Then she prayed him for the Loue which at other times he bare
hir and for his courtesie, that she might not receyue in hys house any
thing that should be dishonorable to hir person, ne yet to hir husband,
but so soone as it was Daye to suffer hir to goe home to hir owne House:
whereunto maister Gentil answered: “Madam, what soeuer I haue desired in
time past, now am I fully purposed neuer to demaund any thyng specially
in this place or in any other but the safety of your honour, and that I
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page358" id = "page358">358</a></span>
would doe to myne owne sister, sith it hath pleased God to showe me that
pleasure, as by my meanes you are reuiued from death to life, and to
delyuer you to mee in consideration of the loue that I haue born you
heretofore: but this good worke, which this Nyghte I haue done for you,
well deserueth some recompence. Wherefore my desire is, that you deny me
not the pleasure which I shall demaund:” whome the gentlewoman
curteously answered, that shee was very ready, so the same were honest
and in hir power to doe. Then sayd mayster Gentil: “Mystresse, all your
kin and al they of Bologna, doe beleue for a trouth that you bee deade,
wherefore there is none that loketh for your recouery agayne: and the
pleasure then whych I demaund, is that you wyll vouchsafe secretlye to
tarry here wyth my mother, vntill I retourne from Modena, which shal be
with so great expedition as I can: and the cause why I desire the same,
is, for that I intend to make a fayre and acceptable present of you vnto
your husband in the presence of the principal of this City.” The
gentlewoman knowing hir self to be greatly bound to the knight, and that
hys request was honest, was content to doe what hee demaunded. Albeit
shee desired earnestly to reioyce hir frendes for hir recouered life,
and so promised vppon hir faith. And vnnethes had she ended hir talke,
but she felt the pain of chyldbirth: wherfore wyth the ayde of the
mother of maister Gentil, she tarried not long before she was deliuered
of a fayre Sonne, which greatly augmented the ioy of maister Gentil and
hir. Mayster Gentil commaunded that she should haue al thyngs that were
necessary to be ministred vnto hir, and that she should be vsed as his
owne Wyfe. Then he pryuily returned to Modena, where when he had a while
supplied his office, he returned to Bologna, and prepared a great feast
at his house, the same morning that he arriued, for diuers gentlemen of
the city, amongs whom Nicholas Chasennemie was one. When the company of
the bidden guests wer com, (the gentlewoman in so good health and lykyng
as euer she was, and hir Child wel and lusty), he sate down amongs them
doing vnto them incomparable myrth and pastime, and serued them
bountifully wyth dyuers sortes of meates. When dinner was almost done,
hauing before told the Gentlewoman what he ment to doe, and in what
manner
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page359" id = "page359">359</a></span>
she should behaue hir selfe, he began thus to say: “My Maysters,
I&nbsp;do remember that whilom I haue hearde tell that in the Country of
Persia, there was a goodly custom (as&nbsp;me seemeth) that when som one
was disposed to do great honour vnto his friend, he bad hym home to his
house, and there shewed him the thing whych he loued best, were it wyfe,
woman, or daughter, or what so euer it were, affirming that like as he
disdayned not to shew the same, which outwardly he loued best, euen so
he would if it were possible, willingly discouer his owne heart: whych
custome I purpose to obserue in this City. Ye of your curtesie haue
vouchsafed to do me so great honour, as to repayre vnto this my simple
feast, which benefite I wyl recompence after the Persian manner, by
shewing vnto you the thinge which I loue moste deerely aboue any in this
worlde, or hereafter shal be able to loue so long as my life endureth:
but before I doe the same, I&nbsp;pray you to tell mee your opynyon in a
doubte whych I shall propose. There was a certayne person whych in hys
house had a good and Faythfull Seruaunte who became extremely sick: that
Person without attendyng the end of his diseased seruaunt, caused him to
be caried into the midst of the streate wythout any further care for
him. In the meane tyme there came a straunger by, who moued by
compassion of the sicke seruaunt, bare him home to his owne house, where
wyth great care and diligence, sparing no cost or charge, made him to
recouer his former healthe: I&nbsp;would now fayne know of you, whither
for retaining and vsing the seruice of that seruaunt, his first maister
by good right myghte complayne vpon the seconde, if he should demaund
hym agayne, or by demaunding of him agayne, the second not disposed to
restore him, might susteyne any damage.” The gentlemen after many
opinions and arguments debated too and fro amonges them, and at length
all concluding in one mind, gaue charge to Nicholas Chasennemie,
(bicause he was an eloquent talker) to make the answer: who first
praising the Persians custome, said that he was, (with the rest) of this
opinion, that the first maister had no further title in his seruaunt,
hauing in sutch necessity not onely forsaken him, but throwen him into
the streate, and that for the good turnes whych the second maister had
don him, he ought by good right to be hys: wherefore by kepyng
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page360" id = "page360">360</a></span>
him, he did no wrong, force, or iniury to the first. Al the rest at the
Table (which were very discret and honest persons) sayd altogyther that
they were of hys opinion. The knight content with that answer, and
specially bycause Nicholas Chasennemie had pronounced it, affyrmed that
hee was likewyse of that minde, and afterwards he sayd: “Time it is then
that I render vnto you the honor which you haue done me, in manner
accordyngly as I haue promysed.<ins class = "addition" title =
"close quote missing">”</ins>
Then he called vnto him two of hys Seruaunts, and
sent them to the Gentlewoman, whom hee had caused to be apparelled and
decked very gorgeously, praying hir by hir presence to content and
satisfie al the company. And she taking in hir armes hir little faire
sonne, came into the hall, accompanied with the two Seruauntes, and was
placed (as&nbsp;it pleased the kynght) besides a very honest gentleman,
and then he sayde: “Syrs, behold the thing which I loue best, and
purpose to loue aboue all worldly things, and whither I haue occasion so
to doe, your eyes may bee Iudges.” The gentlemen doing their reuerence
unto hir, greatly praised hir, and said to the Knight that ther was good
reason why she oughte to be beloued: Vpon which commendations they began
more attentyuely to behold hir, and many of them would haue sayd and
sworne that it had bin shee in deede if it had not bin thought that she
had bin dead. But Nicholas beheld hir more than the rest, who very
desirous to know what she was, could not forbeare (when he saw that the
Knight was a little departed from the place) to aske hir whyther shee
was of Bologna, or a straunger. When the Gentlewoman saw hir husband to
ask hir that question, she could scarce forbeare from making aunswere,
notwithstanding to atchieue that whych was purposed, she helde hir
peace. Another asked her yf that little Boye was hers: And another if
shee were the Wyfe of mayster Gentil, or any kin vnto hym: vnto whom
shee gaue no answere at all. But when maister Gentil came in, one of the
straungers sayd vnto him: “Syr, thys gentlewoman is a very good
creature, but she seemeth to be dumbe. Is it true or not?” “Syrs,<ins
class = "addition" title = "close quote missing">”</ins> sayde maister
Gentil, “that is but a little argument of hir vertue for this time to
hold hir peace.” “Tell vs then (sayde&nbsp;he) what is she?” “That wil I
do very gladly,” sayd the knight, “vnder condition that none of you
shall remoue out of his place for
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page361" id = "page361">361</a></span>
any thing I speake, vntill I haue ended my tale:” which request being
graunted, and the table taken vp, maister Gentil which was set downe by
the Gentlewoman, sayd: “My maysters, this gentlewoman is the loyall and
faithful seruant, of whom earst I propounded the question, whom I haue
releeued from amids the streate, whither hir kin, little caring for hir,
threw hir as a vile and vnprofitable thing: and haue by my great care
brought to passe, that I haue discharged hir from death, vpon an
affection which God knoweth to be so pure and perfect, as of a lumpe of
dead lothsome flesh hee hath reuiued so fayre and freshe as you see: but
to the intent you may more playnly vnderstand how it is come to passe,
I&nbsp;will open the same in few words.” And beginning at the day when
he fell in loue with hir, he particularly told them, what had chaunced
till that time, to the great maruell and admiration of them that heard
him, and then added these woordes: “By meanes whereof, if your minde be
not chaunged within this litle time, and specially master Nicholas, of
good right she is my wife, and none by iust title can clayme hir.”
Whereunto none at al made answere, looking that he shoulde haue
proceeded further. In the meane while Nicholas and the rest that were
there, fell into earnest weepinge. But maister Gentil, rising from the
borde and taking in his armes the little childe, and the gentlewoman by
the hand, went towardes Nicholas, and sayd vnto him: “Rise vp sir
gossip, I&nbsp;do not restore vnto thee thy Wife, whom thy frends and
householde did cast into the Streat, but I will geue thee this
Gentlewoman my Gossip, with the litle childe, that is, as I am assured
begotten of thee, for whom at the christening I made answere and
promise, and called him Gentil, and do pray thee that she be no lesse
esteemed of thee now (for being in my house almost three moneths) than
she was before. For I swere by the almighty God, who made me in loue
with hir, (peraduenture that my loue might be the cause of hir
preseruation) that she neuer liued more honestly with hir father,
mother, or with thee, than she hath done in company of my mother.” When
he had sayd so, he returned towards the Gentlewoman, and sayd vnto hir:
“Maistresse, from this time forth, I&nbsp;discharge you of the promise
which you haue made me, and leaue you to your husband franke and free.”
And when he
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page362" id = "page362">362</a></span>
had bestowed the gentlewoman, and the chylde in the fathers armes, he
returned to his place agayne. Nicholas ioyfully receyued his Wyfe and
childe, for the whych so mutch the more he reioysed, as hee was furthest
of from hope of hir recouery, rendering inumerable thankes to the Knight
and the rest, and moued with compassion hee wept for company, greatly
praysing maister Gentil for that act, who was commended of ech man that
heard the reporte thereof. The Gentlewoman was receiued into hir house
wyth maruellous ioye: And longe tyme after she was gazed vpon by the
Citizens of Bologna, as a thing to their great wonder reuiued agayne.
Afterwards Maister Gentil continued styll a friend vnto Nicholas, and
vnto hys Wyfe and Chyldren.</p>

<p class = "summary">
Saladine in the habite of a Marchaunt, was honourably receyued into the
house of mayster Thorello, who went ouer the Sea, in company of the
Christians, and assigned a terme of his wyfe when she should mary
agayne. He was taken, and caried to the Sovldan to be his Faulconer, who
knowing him, and suffering himself to be knowen, did him great honour.
Mayster Thorello fell sicke, and by Magique Art, was caried in a night
to Pavie, where he found his wyfe about to mary agayne, who knowinge
him, returned home with him to his owne house.</p>


<p><span class = "firstword">Very</span> comely it is (sayeth Cicero in
the second booke of hys Offices,) that Noblemens houses should styll be
open to noble Guestes and Straungers. A&nbsp;saying by the honourable
and other Estates to be fixed in sure remembraunce, and accordingly
practised: For hospitality and houshold intertaynment, heaping vp double
gayne and commodity. The Guest it linketh and knitteth in fast band of
perfect friendship, common familiarity, disporte of mynde and pleasant
recreation, the poore and needy it feedeth, it cherisheth, it prouoketh
in them deuout prayers, godly blessings, and seruice in tyme of neede.
Hospitality is a thing so diuine, as in law of Nature and Chryst, it was
well and brotherly obserued. Lot disdayned not to receyue the Aungels,
which were straungers vnto him, and by reason of hys common vse thereof,
and theyr frendly intertaynment, he and his houshold was delyuered from
the daunger of the City, escaped temporal fire, and obteined heauenly
rewarde. Abraham was a friendly host to straungers, and therefore in his
old dayes, and in the barrein age of his wyfe Sara, he begat Isaac.
Ietro albeit he was an Ethnicke and vnbeleuyng man, yet lyberally
intertained Moyses, and maried him to Sephora, one of his Daughters. The
poore widow of Sarepta interteined Helias, and Symon the Currior
disdayned not Peter, nor Lydia the purple silke woman, Paule and his
fellowes. Forget not Hospitality, (saith the said Apostle Paule,) for
wyth the same diuers haue pleased Aungels by receiuing them into theyr
houses. If Paule
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page364" id = "page364">364</a></span>
the true preacher of eternall Healthe, hath so commended kepyng of good
Houses which by the former terme wee call Hospitality, then it is a
thing to bee vsed amonges those that bee able to mainteine the same: who
ought with liberall hand frankely to reach bread and victuals to their
acquaintance, but specially to straungers, whych wandering in forein
places, be vtterly vnable to helpe themselues, and peraduenture in sutch
neede, as without sutch curtesie, do perishe. For the further
amplification of whych vertue, what shall I neede to remember straunge
and prophane Histories? as of Symon of Athens, who was so famous in the
same, as the tyrant Crytias, when he wished for the ryches of Scopades
and the victories of Agesilaus, forgat not also to craue the liberality
of Cimon. Pacuuius also, the Prynce of Campania, so friendly entertained
Annibal, as when his sonne to do the Romanes a good turne, would haue
killed him as he sat at supper, was staied by his fathers request (whom
he made priuy of his intent before they sate downe.) Pacuuius had he not
more regarded the office of hospitality, than the safety of his
countrey, might ful wel by that murder, haue defended the same from the
destruction whereunto afterwards it fel. Homere reporteth, that Menelaus
fighting a combat with Paris of Troy made inuocation and prayer vnto the
Gods, that he might be reuenged vpon him for the rape of his wife
Helena, to the intent the posterity hearing of his punishmente, mighte
feare to polute friendly housholde interteynment. Wherefore, sith
hospitality hath bene thus put in vse in elder tyme, practysed in all
ages, and the poluters of the same detested and accurssed, and hath
notorious commodities incident vnto it, I&nbsp;deeme it so worthy to be
frequented in noble men and all degrees, as theyr Palaces and great
houses should swarme wyth guests, and their gates lustring with whole
multitudes of the poore to be satisfied with relief. Sutch hath ben the
sacred vse and reuerent care of auncient tyme. Sutch hath bene the
zealous loue of those whose fieldes and barnes, closets, and chestes
haue bene stored and stuffed with worldely wealth, that comparing that
golden age, glistering with piety and vertue, to these our worsse than
copper days, cancred with all corruption, we shal find the match so
like, as darke and light, durt and Aungell golde. Ceasing then of
further discourse hereof,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page365" id = "page365">365</a></span>
this history folowing shall elucidate and displaye the mutuall
beneuolence of two noble personages, the one a mighty Souldan, an enimy
of God, but yet a fryende to those that fauored good entertainment and
housekepyng: the other a Gentleman of Pauie, a&nbsp;rich and liberall
marchaunt, and a friendly welcomer of straungers. The Souldan demaunding
the way to Pauie, somewhat digressing from the same, is not onely
honourably conueyed to Pauie, and feasted there, but also sumptuously
cheryshed, banketted, and rewarded by the sayd Marchant before his
commyng thyther. The marchant man desirous to be one of the holye voyage
intended by christian Princes, passed ouer the seas, who put to his
shifts there throughe the aduerse lucke receyued by the Christians,
became the Souldans Fawconer, and afterwardes knowen vnto him by
certaine markes and signes, is with greater honor intertained of the
Souldan, and more richly guerdoned, sent home agayne by Magike Arte to
anticipate the mariage of his wife, vnto whom he had prefixed a certaine
date and terme to marry againe if before that tyme, he did not returne.
All which Noble entertainment, and the circumstances thereof, in this
manner do begin. In the time of the Emperour Fredericke the firste, the
Chrystians to recouer the Holy Lande, made a generall voyage and passage
ouer the Sea. Saladine a most vertuous Prynce, then Souldan of Babylon,
hauing intelligence thereof, a&nbsp;certayne time before, determined in
his own person to see and espy the preparation which the Christian
Princes made for that passage, the better to prouide for his owne, and
hauing put order for his affayres in Ægypt, making as though he would go
on Pilgrimage, tooke his iourney in the apparel of a Marchant,
accompanied only with two of his chiefest and wisest counsellers, and
three seruaunts. And when he had searched and trauelled many christian
prouinces, and riding through Lumbardy to passe ouer the Mountaynes, it
chaunced that betweene Millan and Pauy, somwhat late he met wyth a
gentleman named mayster Thorello de Istria of Pauy, who with his
houshoulde, his dogges and hawkes, for his pleasure went to soiorne in
one of his Manours, that was delectably placed upon the ryuer of Tesino.
And when maister Thorello sawe them come, thinckinge that they were
certayn Gentlemen straungers, he desired to do them honour. Wherefore
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page366" id = "page366">366</a></span>
Saladine demaunding of one of mayster Thorello his men, how farre it was
from thence to Pauie, and whether they might come thither time inough to
go in, master Thorello would not suffer his man to speake, but he
himself made aunswere, saying: “sirs, yee cannot get into Pauie in time,
for that the Gates will be shut before your comming.” Than sayd
Saladine: “tell us then wee pray you, bicause we be straungers, where
wee may lodge this night.” Maister Thorello sayd: “That will I willingly
do, I&nbsp;was about euen presently to send one of my men that be here,
so far as Pauie, about certayne businesse, him wil I appoint to be your
guide to a place where you shall haue very good lodging,” and callinge
one of his wysest men vnto him, he gaue him charge of that he had to do,
and sent him with them, after whom he followed: where incontynently in
so good order as he could, caused to be made redy a sumptuous supper,
and the tables to be couered in a pleasant garden. Afterwards hee went
himselfe to entertayne them. The seruaunt talking with the Gentlemen of
many thinges, conducted them at leysure somwhat out of the way to
protract the time, to his maysters house: and so soon as maister
Thorello espied them, he with liberall heart and bountifull mynde bad
them welcome. Saladine which was a very wyse man, well perceyued that
the Gentleman doubted that they woulde not haue come vnto hym if he had
inuited them at their first meetinge, and for that cause, to the intent
they should not refuse to lodge at his house, he had pollitiquely caused
them to be conducted thither, and aunsweringe hys greeting, sayd: “Syr,
if a man may quarrell with them that be curteous, wee may complayne of
you, who leauinge a part our way which you haue caused somewhat to be
lengthened, without deseruinge your good will, otherwise than by one
onely salutation, you haue constrayned vs to take and receyue this your
so great curtesie.” The wise and well spoken Knight, sayd: “Syr, thys
curtesie which you receyue of me, in respect of that which belongeth
vnto you, as by your countenaunce I may wel coniecture, is very small,
but truely out of Pauie ye could haue got no lodging that had ben good:
and therefore be not displeased I pray you to be caried out of the way,
to haue a little better intertaynment,” and saying so, his men came
forth to receyue those straungers, and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page367" id = "page367">367</a></span>
when they were lighted, their horsses were taken and conueyed into the
stables, and mayster Thorello caryed the three Gentlemen to their
chambers, which he had prepared for them, where their Bootes were pulled
of, and excellent wyne brought forth, somewhat to refresh them before
supper: then he held them with pleasaunt talke vntyll the houre of
supper was com. Saladine and they which were with him, could all speake
Latine, and therefore well vnderstanded, and they lykewise vnderstoode
eche man, by meanes whereof euery of them, thought that the Gentleman
was the most curteous and best conditioned Personage, indued with the
most eloquent talke that euer they sawe. On the other side it seemed to
mayster Thorello, that they were the noblest and Princelik personages,
and far more worthy of estimation then he thought before. Wherefore, he
was very angry wyth himselfe, that he had no greater company and better
intertaynment for them that night, which he purposed to recompence the
next day at dinner. Wherefore hee sent one of hys men to Pauie, being
not farr from thence, to his wife, that was a very wise and noble
gentlewoman, and afterwards he brought them into the garden where he
curteously demaunded what they were. To whom Saladine answered: “we be
marchaunts of Cypres trauailing to Paris, about our businesse.” Then
said maister Thorello: “I&nbsp;would to God that this country brought
forth such gentlemen as the land of Cypres maketh marchants,” and so
passed the time from one talke to another, vntyll supper time came:
Wherefore to honour them the better caused them to sit downe at the
Table, euery of them according to his degree and place: And there they
were exceadingly wel intreated and serued in good order, their supper
being farre more bountifull than they looked for. And they sate not
longe after that the table was taken away, but maister Thorello
supposing them to be weary, caused them to be lodged in gorgeous and
costly beds: and he likewyse within a while after went to bed. The
seruaunt sent to Pauie, did the message to his mistresse, who not like a
woman wyth a womanish heart, but like one of Princely Mind,
incontinently caused many of her husband’s frends and seruaunts to be
sent for. Afterwards she made ready a great feast, and inuited the
noblest and chiefest Citizens of the City:
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page368" id = "page368">368</a></span>
apparelling hir house wyth clothe of gold and silke, tapistrie and other
furnitures, putting in order all that which hir husband had commaunded.
The next day in the morning the Gentleman rose, with whom maister
Thorello mounted on horsebacke, and carying with him his Hawks, he
brought them to the Ryuer, and shewed them diuers flightes. But Saladine
demaunding where the best lodging was in Pauie, maister Thorello sayd:
“I&nbsp;wyll shew you my selfe, for that I haue occasion to go thither.”
They beleeuing him, were contented, and rode on their way, and being
about nine of the clock, arriued at the City, thinking they should haue
ben brought to the best Inne of the towne: but maister Thorello conueyed
them to his owne house, where fiftye of the chiefest Citizens ready to
receiue them sodaynly appeared before them. Which Saladine, and they
that were wyth him perceyuinge, coniectured by and by what that dyd
meane, and sayd: “Maister Thorello, this is not the request whych wee
demaunded, your entertainment yesternight was to sumptuous and more then
we desired, wherefore giue vs leaue we praye you to departe.” Whom
maister Thorello answered: “My maisters, for that which ye receyued
yesternight I wil giue thanks to Fortune, and not to you: for I
ouertaking you by the way, forced you in a maner to make your repayre
vnto my homely house: but for thys morninge voyage, I&nbsp;haue my selfe
prepared, and likewyse the Gentlemen about you, with whom to refuse to
dine, if you thincke it curtesie, doe as yee please.” Saladine and his
companions vanquished wyth sutch persuation, lighted, and being receiued
by the Gentlemen in louing and curteous order, were conueied to their
chambers, which were richly furnished for them, and hauing put of their
riding apparel, and somewhat refreshed themselues, they came into the
Hall, where all things were in redinesse in triumphant sorte. Then Water
was brought them to washe, and they placed at the Table, were serued
wyth many delicate meats in magnificent and royal order, in sutch wise,
as if the Emperour himselfe had bene there coulde not haue bene better
entertayned. And albeit that Saladine and his companions were great
Lordes, and accustomed to see marueylous thynges, yet they wondred very
mutch at thys, considering the degree of the Knight, whom they knewe to
bee but a Citizen
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page369" id = "page369">369</a></span>
and no Prynce or great Lord. When dinner was done, and that they had
talked a little together, the weather waxing very hot, the Gentlemen of
Pauie, (as&nbsp;it pleased mayster Thorello) went to take their rest,
and he remayned wyth his three Guests: with whom he went into a chamber,
where to the intent that nothing which he had and loued might be
vnseene, caused his honest Wyfe to be called forth: who being very
beautiful and wel fauored, clothed in rich and costly array, accompanied
with her two yong sonnes, which were like to Aungels, came before them,
and gratiously saluted them. When they saw her, they rose vp, and
reuerently receiued hir, then they caused hir to sit downe in the mids
of them, sporting and dalying with hir two fayre sonnes. But after she
had pleasantly entred in talk, she asked them of whence they were, and
whither they were going? To whom the Gentlemen made the same aunswere
that they had done before to maister Thorello. Then the Gentlewoman sayd
vnto them with smilinge cheere: “I&nbsp;perceyue then that mine aduice
being a woman, is come well to passe. And therefore I pray you, that of
your special grace you will do me this pleasure, as not to refuse or
disdain the litle present that I shall bring before you, but that you
take it, in consideration that women according to their little ability,
giue little things, and that yee regard more the affection of the person
whych offreth the gist, then the value of the giuen thing.” And causing
to be brought before euery of them two fayre Roabes, the one lined with
silke, and the other with Meneuayr, not in fashion of a Citizen, or of a
Marchant, but Noblemanlike, and <span class = "smallroman">III.</span>
Turkey gownes with sleeues of Taffata, lined with linnen cloth, she
sayde vnto them: “Take I pray you these roabes, with the like whereof
this day I apparelled my husband, and the other things may also serue
your turnes, although they be little worth, considering that yee be
farre from your Wyues, and the greatnesse of your iorney, which you haue
taken, and haue yet to make, and also for that Marchantmen loue to be
neat, and fine in things appertinent to their bodies.” The Gentlemen
mutch maruelled, and playnly knew that Maister Thorello was disposed not
to forget any one part of curtesie towards them, and doubted
(by&nbsp;reason of the beauty and richesse of the roabes not
marchantlike,) that they
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page370" id = "page370">370</a></span>
should not be knowne of mayster Thorello, notwithstandinge one of them
aunswered her: “These be (Gentlewoman) very great gifts, and ought not
lightly to be accepted, if your intreaty did not constraine vs, against
which no denial ought to be made.” That done, when mayster Thorello
returned into the chamber, the Gentlewoman tooke her leaue, and went hir
way: and then shee furnished the seruants with diuers other things
necessary for them, and Mayster Thorello obtayned by earnest request,
that they should tary all that day. Wherefore after they had rested
themselues a while, they did put on their roabes, and walked forth on
horsebacke into the Citty: and when supper tyme was come, they were
bountifully feasted in honorable company: and when bed time approched,
went to rest. And so soone as it was day they rose, and founde in steade
of their weary Hackneyes, three fat and fayre Palfreyes, and also the
like number of fresh and mighty horsses for their seruaunts: Which
Saladine seeing, turned towardes his companions, and sayd vnto them:
“I&nbsp;sweare by God that ther was neuer a more liberall Gentleman,
more courteous or better conditioned than this is. And if Christian
kings for their part be sutch, I&nbsp;meane indued with sutch kingly
qualities as this Gentleman is, the Souldan of Babylon shall haue inough
to do to deale with one, and not to attend for all those which we see to
be in preparation for inuasion of his Country.” But seeing that to
refuse them or render them agayne, serued to no purpose, they thanked
him very humbly, and got vppon their horse. Mayster Thorello wyth many
of his frends, accompanied them out of the Citty a great peece of the
way: And albeit that it mutch greeued Saladine to depart from mayster
Thorello (so&nbsp;farre in he was already in loue with him) yet being
constrayned to forgo his company, hee prayed him to returne, who
although very loth to depart, sayd unto them: “Syrs, I&nbsp;will be
gone, sith it is your pleasure I shall so do, and yet I say vnto you,
that I know not what you be, ne yet demaund to know, but so farre as
pleaseth you. But what soeuer yee be, you shall not make me beleue at
this tyme, that yee be marchauntes, and so I bid you farewell.” Saladine
hauing taken hys leaue of those that accompanied mayster Thorello,
answered him: “Syr, it may come to passe, that we may let you see
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page371" id = "page371">371</a></span>
our marchaundise, the better to confirme your beleefe.” And so departed.
Saladine then hauing thus taken his leaue, assuredly determined if he
liued, and that the Warres he looked for did not let him, to do no lesse
honor to mayster Thorello, then he had done to him, and fell into great
talke with his companions of him, of his Wyfe and of his things, acts
and deedes, greatly praysing all his entertaynment. But after he had
trauayled and vewed al the west parts, imbarkinge himselfe and his
company, he returned to Alexandria, throughly informed of his enemies
indeuors, prepared for his defence. Mayster Thorello returned to Pauie,
and mused a long time what these three might be, but he coulde not so
mutch as gesse, what they were. When the tyme of the appoynted passage
for the Chrystians was come, and that great preparation generally was
made, Mayster Thorello notwithstandinge the teares and prayers of his
Wyfe, was fully bent to go thither, and hauinge set all thinges in order
for that Voyage, and ready to get on horsebacke, he sayd vnto hir whom
he perfectly loued: “Sweete Wyfe, I&nbsp;am goinge as thou seest, this
Iourney, aswell for myne honour sake, as for health of my soule:
I&nbsp;recommende vnto you our goodes and honor: And bycause I am not so
certayne of my retourne, for a thousand accydentes that may chaunce, as
I am sure to goe, I&nbsp;praye thee to doe mee thys pleasure, that what
so euer chaunceth of mee, yf thou haue no certayne newes of my life,
that yet thou tarry one yeare, one Moneth, and one day, the same terme
to begin at the day of my departure.” The Gentlewoman whych bytterly
wept, answered: “I&nbsp;know not dear husband how I shal be able to
beare the sorrowe wherein you leaue mee, if you goe awaye: But yf my
Lyfe bee more stronge and sharpe, than sorrowe it selfe: and whether you
lyue or dye, or what so euer come of you, I&nbsp;wyll lyue and dye the
Wyfe of Mayster Thorello, and the onely spouse of hys remembraunce.”
Whereunto mayster Thorello sayde: “Sweete Wyfe, I&nbsp;am more than
assured that touching your selfe, it wyll proue as you do promise: But
you beyng a younge Woman, fayre, and well allyed, and your Vertue greate
and well knowne throughoute the Countrye, I&nbsp;am sure that many
greate Personages and gentlemen (if&nbsp;any suspytyon bee conceyued of
my Death) wyll make requestes to your brethren and Kindred, from whose
pursute

(althoughe you be not disposed,) you can not defende your selfe, and it
behoueth that of force, you please theyr wil, whych is the onely reason
that moueth mee to demaunde that terme, and no longer tyme.” The
Gentlewoman sayd: “I&nbsp;wil doe what I can for fulfilling of my
promyse: And albeit in the ende that I shall bee constrayned to doe
contrary to my lykyng, be assured that I wyll obey the charge whych nowe
you haue gyuen me: And I moste humbly thanke Almyghty God, that hee
neuer brought vs into these termes before this tyme.” Theyr talke ended,
the Gentlewoman weepyng embraced mayster Thorello, and drawyng a Ryng
from hir Fynger, she gaue it hym, sayinge: “If it chaunce that I dye
before I see you, remember me when you shal beholde the same.” He
receiuinge the ring, got vp vppon his horse, and takinge his leaue, went
on hys voyage, and arriued at Genoua shipped himself in a Galley, and
toke his way, whereunto wind and weather so fauored, as wythin fewe
dayes he landed at Acres, and ioyned wyth the army of the Chrystyans:
wherein began a great mortalytye and Plague, duryng which infection
(what so euer was the cause) eyther by the industrie or Fortune of
Saladine the rest of the Christians that escaped were almost taken and
surprised by him, without any fighte or blowe stricken. All which were
imprysoned in many cities, and deuided into diuers places, amongs whych
prysoners maister Thorello was one, who was caryed captyue to
Alexandria, where beyng not knowne, and fearyng to be knowne, forced of
necessitie, gaue him selfe to the keepyng of Hawkes, a&nbsp;qualitie
wherein he had very good skyll, whereby in the ende hee grew to the
acquaintance of the Souldan, who for that occasion (not knowing him that
time) toke hym out of pryson, and retayned him for his Fawconer. Maister
Thorello which was called of the Souldan by none other name than
Chrystian, whome hee neyther knewe, ne yet the Souldan him, had none
other thing in his mynde and remembraunce but Pauia, and manye tymes
assayed to escape and run away: But he neuer came to the poynt: Wherfore
dyuers Ambassadoures from Genoua being come to Saladine, to raunsome
certayne of theyr Prysoners, and being ready to returne, hee thought to
wryte vnto his wyfe, to let hir know that he was aliue, and that hee
would come home so
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page373" id = "page373">373</a></span>
soone as he coulde, praying hir to tarry his retourne: Which was the
effecte of hys Letter: verye earnestly desiring one of the ambassadours
of his acquayntaunce to doe so mutch for hym as safely to delyuer those
Letters to the Handes of the Abbot of <i>S.&nbsp;Pietro in ciel
Doro</i>, whych was hys Vncle. And Mayster Thorello standing vppon these
termes, it chaunced vpon a day as Saladine was talking with him of his
Hawkes, Thorello began to smyle and to make a Iesture wyth hys mouth,
whych Saladine beyng at his house at Pauie did very well note, by which
act Saladine began to remember him, and earnestly to viewe hym, and
thought that it was he in deede. Wherefore leauing his former talke, he
sayd: “Tell me Chrystian of what countrey art thou in the West parts?”
“Sir” sayd Mayster Thorello, “I&nbsp;am a Lombarde, of a City called
Pauie, a&nbsp;poore man and of meane estate.” So soone as Saladine heard
that, as assured wherof he doubted, said to himself: “God hath giuen me
a time to let thys man know how thankfully I accepted his curtesy that
hee vsed towards me,<ins class = "addition" title = "close quote missing">”</ins>
and without any more words, hauing caused all his apparell in a chamber
to be set in order, he broughte him into the same and sayd: “Behold
Christian, if amonges al these roabes, there be any one which thou hast
seene before.<ins class = "addition" title = "close quote missing">”</ins>
Maister Thorello began to looke vpon them, and
saw those which his wyfe had giuen to Saladine: but he could not beleue
that it was possible that they should be the same, notwithstanding hee
answered: “Sir, I&nbsp;knowe them not, albeit my mind giueth me that
these twayne do resemble the roabes which sometimes I ware, and caused
them to be giuen to three marchaunt men that were lodged at my house.”
Then Saladine not able to forbear any longer, tenderly imbraced him,
saying: “You be maister Thorello de Istria, and I am one of the three
Marchaunts to whom your wife gaue those roabes: and now the time is come
to make you certenly beleue what my marchaundise is, as I tolde you when
I departed from you that it myght come to passe.” Maister Thorello
hearyng those wordes, began to be both ioyfull and ashamed, ioyfull for
that he had entertained sutch a guest, and ashamed that his fare and
lodging was so simple. To whom Saladine said: <ins class = "addition"
title = "open quote missing">“</ins>maister Thorello, sith it hath
pleased god to send you hither, thynke from henceforth that you be Lord
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page374" id = "page374">374</a></span>
of this place and not I.” <ins class = "correction" title =
"error for ‘And’">and</ins> making great chere, and reioysing one wyth an other, he
caused him to be cloathed in royall vestures, and brought him into the
presence of al the Noble men of his country: and after he had rehersed
many thinges of his valor and commendation, commaunded him to be
honoured as his owne person, of all those which desired to haue his
fauor: Which thing euery Man dyd from that time forth: but aboue the
rest, the two Lords that were in company with Saladine at his house. The
greatnesse of the sodain glory wherein maister Thorello sawe himselfe,
did remoue oute of his mind, his affayres of Lombardie, and specially,
bicause hee hoped that his letters should trustely be deliuered to the
hands of his vncle. Now there was in the camp of the Christians the daye
wherein they were taken by Saladine, a&nbsp;Gentleman of Prouince, which
dyed and was buryed, called maister Thorello de Dignes, a&nbsp;man of
great estimation: whereby (maister Thorello of Istria known through out
the whole army for his nobility and prowesse) euery man that heard tell
that maister Thorello was dead, beleued that it was mayster Thorello de
Istria, and not he de Dignes, and by reason of his taking, the truth
whether of them was deade, was vnknown: Wherfore many Italians returned
with those newes, amongs whom som wer so presumptuous, as they toke vpon
them to saye and affyrme that they saw him deade, and were at his
burial: Whych knowen to his wyfe and his friends, was an occasion of
very great and inestimable Sorrow, not onely to them: but to all other
that knewe him. Very long it were to tell what great sorrow, heauinesse,
and lamentation his wife did vtter, who certain moneths after shee had
continually so tormented hir selfe, (and when hir grief began to
decrease, being demaunded of many great personages of Lombardie) was
counselled by hir brothers, and other of hir kin, to mary again. Which
thing after she had many times refused, in very great anguish and dolor,
finally being constrained thereunto, she yelded to the minds of hir
parents: But yet vpon condicion, that the nuptials should not be
celebrate vntyll sutch tyme as she had performed hir promise made to
maister Thorello. Whilest the affaires of this Gentlewoman were in those
termes at Pauie, and the time of hir appoyntment within eight dayes
approched, it
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page375" id = "page375">375</a></span>
chaunced that maister Thorello vpon a day espyed a man in Alexandria,
(which hee had seene before in the company of the Ambassadors of
Genoua,) going into the galley that was bound with them to Genoua,
wherfore causing him to be called, he demaunded what voyage they had
made, and asked him when they arriued at Genoua? To whom he sayd: “Sir
the Galley made a very ill voyage as I hard say in Creta, where I
remayned behynd them, for being neare the coast of Sicilia there rose a
maruellous tempest, which droue the galley vpon the shoare of Barbarie,
and not one of them within bord escaped, amongs whom two of my brethren
were likewise drowned.” Mayster Thorello giuing credite to the words of
this fellow, which were very true, and remembring himselfe that the
terme whych he had couenaunted with his Wyfe was almost expired, and
thinkinge that they could hardly come by the knowledge of any newes of
hym or of his state, beleued verily that his Wyfe was maried agayne, for
sorrow whereof he fell into sutch melancholy, as he had no lust to eate
or drinke, and laying him downe vpon his bed, determined to die: whych
so soone as Saladine, (who greatly loued hym) did vnderstand, he came to
visite him, and after that he had (through instant request) knowen the
occasion of his heauinesse and disease, hee blamed him very mutch for
that he did no sooner disclose vnto him his conceipt: And afterwards
prayed him to be of good cheere, assuring him if he would, so to prouide
as he shoulde be at Pauie, iust at the terme which he had assigned to
his Wyfe: and declared vnto him the order how. Mayster Thorello geuinge
credit to the words of Saladine, and hauinge many times hard say, that
it was possible, and that the like had bene many times done, began to
comfort himselfe, and to vse the company of Saladine, who determined
fully vpon his voyage and returne to Pauie. Then Saladine commaunded one
of his Nycramancers, (whose science already he had well experienced)
that hee shoulde deuise the meanes how mayster Thorello might be borne
to Pauie in one night, vpon a bed: Whereunto the Nycromancer aunswered
that it should be done, but that it behoued for the better doing
thereof, that he should be cast into a sleepe: And when Saladine had
geuen order thereunto, he returned to mayster Thorello, and finding him
fully
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page376" id = "page376">376</a></span>
purposed to be at Pauy if it were possible at the terme which he had
assigned, or if not, to die: sayd thus vnto hym: “Mayster Thorello, if
you do heartely loue your Wyfe and doubt least she be maried to an
other, God forbid that I should stay you by any manner of meanes,
bicause of all the Women that euer I saw, she is for maners, comely
behauiour, and decent order of apparell, (not remembring her beauty,
which is but a fading floure) mee thyncke most worthy to bee praysed and
loued. A&nbsp;gladsome thynge it woulde haue beene to mee (sith Fortune
sent you hither) that the tyme which you and I haue to liue in this
worlde, we myght haue spent together, and liued Lordes of the Kingdome
which I possesse, and if God be minded not to do me that grace, at least
wyse sith you be determined either to dye or to returne to Pauie, at the
terme which you haue appointed, my great desire is, that I myght haue
knowen the same in time, to the intente you myghte haue bene conducted
thither wyth sutch honour and trayn as your Vertues do deserue: Which
sith God wyl not that it bee brought to passe, and that you wyll neades
be there presently, I&nbsp;wyll send you as I can in manner before
expressed.” Whereunto maister Thorello said: “Sir, the effect (bisides
your wordes) hath don me suffycient knowledge of your good wyll, which I
neuer deserued, and that whych you told me, I&nbsp;cannot beleeue, so
long as Lyfe is in me, and therefore am most certayne to dye: But sith I
am so determyned, I&nbsp;beseeche you to do that which you haue promised
out of hand, bicause to morrow is the last day of the appoyntment
assigned to my wyfe.” Saladine said, that for a truth the same should be
don: And the next day the Souldan purposing to send hym the nyght
following, he caused to be made ready in a great hall a very fayre and
rych bed, all quilted according to their manner (wyth vyluet and clothe
of gold), and caused to be layed ouer the same, a&nbsp;Couerlet wroughte
ouer with borders of very great pearles, and rich precious stones: which
euer afterwardes was deemed to be an infinite treasure, and two pillowes
sutelike vnto that bed: that don, he commaunded that they should inuest
maister Thorello, (who now was lustie) with a Sarazine roabe, the
richest and fairest thing that euer anye Man saw, and vpon his head one
of his longest bands, wreathen according to theyr
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page377" id = "page377">377</a></span>
manner, and being already late in the Euenyng, hee and diuers of his
Barons went into the Chamber wher Mayster Thorello was, and being set
down besides him, in weeping wise hee began to say: “Maister Thorello,
the time of our separation doth now approche, and bicause that I am not
able to accompany you, ne cause you to be waited vpon, for the qualitie
of the way which you haue to passe, I&nbsp;must take my leaue here in
this chamber, for which purpose I am come hither: Wherefore before I byd
you farewel, I&nbsp;pray you for the loue and friendship that is betwene
vs, that you do remember me if it be possible before our dayes do end,
after you haue giuen order to your affayres in Lombardie, to come agayne
to see me before I dye, to the end that I beyng reioyced with your
second visitation, may be satisfied of the pleasure which I lose this
day for your vntimely hast: and trusting that it shall come to passe,
I&nbsp;pray you let it not be tedious vnto you to visite me wyth your
letters, and to require me in thynges wherein it may lyke you to
commaund, which assuredly I shall accomplish more frankely for you, than
for any other liuing man.” Maister Thorello was not able to retaine
teares: wherefore to staye the same, he answered him in few woordes,
that it was impossible that euer hee shoulde forget his benefites, and
his worthy friendship extended vpon him, and that without default he
would accomplish what he had commaunded, if God did lend him life and
leysure. Then Saladine louingly imbracing and kissing him, pouring forth
many teares, bad him farewell, and so went oute of the chamber: And all
the other Noble men afterwards tooke theyr leaue likewise of him, and
departed with Saladine into the hal wher he had prepared the bed, but
being already late, and the Necromancer attending, and hasting his
dispatch, a&nbsp;Phisitian broughte him a drinke, and made him beleue
that it would fortifie and strengthen him in his iorney, causing him to
drinke the same: which being done within a while after he fell a sleepe,
and so sleeping was borne by the commaundment of Saladine, and layd vpon
the fayre bed, whereupon he placed a rich and goodly crowne of passinge
pryce and valor, vpon the which he had ingrauen so plaine an
inscription, as afterwards it was knowne that the same was sent by
Saladine to the wife of maister Thorello. After that he put a
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page378" id = "page378">378</a></span>
ring vpon his finger whych was beset wyth a Diamonde, so shining, as it
seemed like a flamynge Torche, the Value whereof was hard to bee
esteemed. Then he caused to bee girte aboute hym, a&nbsp;Sworde, the
furniture and garnishing whereof could not easily be valued: and besides
all thys, hee honge vppon hys Necke a Tablet or Brooche so beset wyth
Stones, and Pearles, as the lyke was neuer seene. And afterwards he
placed on either of hys sides, two exceding great Golden basens, full of
double Ducates, and many cordes of Pearles and rings, girdels, and other
things to tedious to reherse, wherewith he bedecked the place about him.
Which done, he kissed him againe, and wylled the Necromancer to make
hast. Wherfore incontinently maister Thorello, and the bed, in the
presence of Saladine was caried out of sight and Saladine taried stil,
deuising and talkyng of hym amongs his Barons. Maister Thorello being
now laid in S.&nbsp;Peter Churche at Pauie, according to his request,
with all his Iewels and habilliments aforesayd about him, and yet fast a
slepe, the Sexten to ring to Mattens, entred the Church with light in
his hand: and chauncing sodenly to espy the rych Bed, dyd not onely
maruel thereat, but also ran away in great feare. And when the Abbot and
the Monkes saw that hee made sutch hast away, they were abashed, and
asked the cause why he ranne so fast? The Sexten tolde them the matter:
“Why how now?” sayde the Abbot, “Thou art not sutch a Babe, ne yet so
newlye come vnto the Church, as thou oughtest so lightly to be afraide.
But let vs goe and see what bug hath so terribly frayed thee.” And then
they lighted many Torches: And when the Abbot and his Monkes were entred
the Church, they saw that wonderfull rich bed, and the Gentleman
sleeping vpon the same. And as they were in this doubte and feere,
beholding the goodly Iewels, and durst not goe neare the bed, it
chaunced that maister Thorello awaked, fetchyng a gret sighe. The Monkes
so soone as they saw that, and the Abbot with them, ran all away crying
out, “God helpe vs, our Lord haue mercy vpon vs.” Maister Thorello
opened his eyes, and playnly knew by loking round about him, that he was
in the place where he demaunded to be of Saladine whereof he was very
glad, and rising vp, and viewing particularily, what he had about him,
albeit he knew before the magnificence of Saladine, now he
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page379" id = "page379">379</a></span>
thoughte it greater, and better vnderstood the same than before. But
seeynge the Monkes run away, and knowyng the cause wherefore, he began
to call the Abbot by hys name, and intreated hym not to bee affrayde:
For he was Mayster Thorello his Nephewe. The Abbot hearyng that was
dryuen into a greater feare, bicause he was accompted to bee dead diuers
moneths before: but afterwards by diuers arguments, assured that hee was
maister Thorello, and so often called by hys name (making a signe of the
Crosse) he went vnto him. To whom maister Thorello sayd: “Whereof be you
a frayd good father? I&nbsp;am aliue I thanke God, and from beyond the
Sea returned hyther.” The Abbot (although he had a great beard, and
apparelled after the guise of Arabie) crossed hymselfe agayne, and was
wel assured that it was he. Then he tooke hym by the hande, and sayde
vnto hym as followeth: “My Sonne thou art welcome home, and maruell not,
that wee were afrayd: For there is none in all thys Citty, but doth
certaynly beleeue that thou art dead. In so mutch as madame Adalietta
thy Wyfe, vanquished with the prayers and threates of hir frinds and
kin, agaynst hir will is betrouthed agayne, and this day the espousals
shall be done. For the mariage, and all the preparation necessary for
the feast, is ready.” Mayster Thorello risinge out of the rich Bed, and
reioysing wyth the Abbot and all his Monks, praied euery of them not to
speake one word of his comminge home, vntill he had done what he was
disposed. Afterwards placing al his rich Iewels in surety and sauegard,
hee discoursed vnto his vncle what had chaunced vnto hym till that time.
The Abbot ioyfull for his fortune, gaue thankes to God. Then mayster
Thorello demaunded of his vncle, what he was that was betrouthed to hys
Wyfe. The Abbot tolde hym: To whom maister Thorello sayd: “Before my
returne be knowen, I&nbsp;am desirous to see what Countenaunce my Wyfe
wyl make at the mariage. And therefore, albeit that the religious doe
not vse to repayre to sutch Feastes, yet I pray you for my sake take
payne to go thither.” The Abbot aunswered that he would willingly doe
so. And so soone as it was Daye, hee sente woorde to the Brydegrome,
that he, and a Frende of hys, woulde bee at the mariage: whereunto the
Gentleman aunswered,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page380" id = "page380">380</a></span>
that he was very glade thereof. When dinner tyme was come, mayster
Thorello in the habite and apparel wherein he was, went with the Lord
Abbot to the weddinge dinner, where euery of them that saw him, did
maruellously beholde hym, but no man knew him, bicause the Abbot
aunswered them that inquired, that he was a Sarazene, sent Ambassador
from the Souldan to the French Kinge. Mayster Thorello was then placed
at a table which was right ouer agaynst his Wyfe, whom he beheld with
great pleasure and delight, and perceyued very wel by hir face that she
was not well content with that mariage. She likewise beheld him
sometimes, not for any knowledge she had of hym, for his great beard and
straunge attire, the firme credite and generall opinion also that hee
was deade, chiefly hindred it. But when mayster Thorello thought tyme to
proue whether she had any remembraunce of him, he secretly conuayed into
hys hande, the ring which she gaue him at hys departure, and called a
little Boy that wayted vpon hir, and sayd vnto him: “Go tell the Bryde
in my behalfe, that the custome of my countrey is, that when any
Straunger (as&nbsp;I am here) is bydden by any new maried woman
(as&nbsp;she is now,) for a token of his welcome, she sendeth vnto him
the cup wherein she drinketh full of Wyne, whereof after the straunger
hath dronke what pleaseth him, he couereth the cup agayne, and sendeth
the same to the Bryde, who drinketh the rest that remayneth.” The Page
did his message vnto the Bryde, who like a wise Gentlewoman wel brought
vp, thinking he had ben some great personage, to declare that he was
welcome, commaunded a great cup all gilt, standing before hir, to be
washed cleane, and to be filled ful of Wyne, and caried to the
Gentleman, which accordingly was don. Mayster Thorello hauing put into
hys mouth the aforesayd ring, secretly let fall the same into the Cup as
he was drinking, not perceyued of any man, to the intent that she
drinking the latter draught, might espy the ringe. When he had dronk, he
returned the cup vnto the Bryde, who thankfully receyued the same. And
for that the manner of his countrey might be accomplished, when the cup
was deliuered vnto hir, she vncouered the same, and pleadging the rest
of the Wyne, beheld the ring, and without speaking any word, wel
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page381" id = "page381">381</a></span>
viewed the same, and knowing that it was the very Ring which she had
geuen to maister Thorello, when he departed, tooke it out. And
stedfastly did marke and looke vpon him, whom she supposed to be a
straunger, and already knowinge him, cryed out as though she had bene
straught of hir wittes, throwing downe the Table before hir: “This is my
Lord and husband, this is of trouth Mayster Thorello.” And runnynge to
the table without respect to hys apparell of Cloth of Gold, or to any
thinge that was vpon the table, pressinge so neere him as she could,
imbraced him very heard, not able to remoue hir handes from about his
Necke for any thing that could bee sayd or done by the company that was
there, vntill mayster Thorello required hir to forbeare for that
present, for so mutch as she shoulde haue leysure inough to vse hir
further imbracements. Then shee left him, and contented hir selfe for
the tyme: but the brydale and mariage was wholly troubled and appalled
for that sodayne chaunce, and the most part of the Guests excedingly
reioyced for the return of that Noble knight. Then the company beinge
intreated to sit and not to remoue, Maister Thorello rehearsed in open
audience what had chaunced vnto him from the day of his departure vntill
that tyme, concludinge with a petition to the Bridegrome, that had newly
espoused his Wyfe, that he woulde not be displeased if he tooke hir
agayne. The new maried Gentleman, albeit it greeued hym very sore, and
thought himselfe to be mocked, aunswered liberally and like a Frende,
that it was in hys power to do wyth hys owne what hee thought best. The
Gentlewoman drawinge of the Rings and Garland which shee had receyued of
hir newe Husbande, did put vppon hir finger the Ring which shee founde
within the Cup, and likewyse the Crowne that was sent vnto hir by
Saladine: And the whole troupe and assembly leauing the house where they
were, went home with mayster Thorello and his wyfe, and there the kin
and frends, and all the Citizens which haunted the same, and regarded it
for a myracle, were with long feastinge and great cheare in great ioy
and triumph. Mayster Thorello departing some of his precious Iewels to
him that had bene at the cost of the marriage, likewise to the Lord
Abbot and diuers others, and hauing done Saladine to vnderstand hys
happy repayre

home to his Countrey, recommending himselfe for euer to his
commaundement, liued with his Wyfe afterwards many prosperous yeares,
vsing the vertue of curtesie more than euer hee did before. Sutch was
the ende of the troubles of maister Thorello, and hys wel beloued Wyfe,
and the recompence of their franke and honest curtesies.</p>

remembraunce. And for you noble Dames for a Christall to sharpen your
sightes, and viewe the recompence of loue, done by a Queene of passing
beauty, and yet most chast and vertuous, that it might somewhat touch
your squeymish stomackes and haulty hearts, and lenifie that corrosiue
humor, which with frowning face, forceth you to ouerperke your humble
suppliants. A&nbsp;helpinge preseruatiue I hope this Hystory shalbe to
imbolden you, in sutes and petitions to their prince and soueraygne: An
incoragement (I&nbsp;hope) to be mediators for sutch, as by seruice and
warfare haue confirmed their faythfull
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page384" id = "page384">384</a></span>
deuoirs for defence of their Countrey. Remember the care the Romane
matrones had for those that deserued well of their Common wealth: as how
they mourned for Lucius Brutus one whole yeres space, for his good
reuenge ouer the rauishers of Lucrece: and for Martius Coriolanus, for
hys piety and mothers sake, discharging his Countrey from the enemies
siege. Let mistresse Paolina of the priuy Chamber to this Queene Anne,
render example for preferment of sutch as be worthy to be cherished and
esteemed. O&nbsp;how Liberality beseemeth a Queene, no lesse
(as&nbsp;one maketh comparison) than the bright beames of the Sunne, or
the twinkling starres in the Firmament. Oh how diligence in Gentlewomen,
aduaunced to Princes Chambers, no lesse than the greene leaues to
braunched Trees, or dyuers coloured Floures in Nosegayes. So flourishing
be the fruites that bud from liberality, and freshe the benefites that
succeede of the payneful trauayles sustayned in the sutes of seruiceable
Gentlemen. This Philippo whom the Queene preferred, and liberally
rewarded, was a meane Gentleman, but yet learned and well furnished with
commendable qualities. His deserued aduauncement may stirre vp ech
Gentle heart, to merite and serue in Common wealth. His warninge and
other vertues may awake the sluggish Courtier, from loytering on
Carpets, and doinge thinges vnseemely: His diligence also reuiue the
blockish sprites of some that rout their tyme in sluggish sleepe, or
waste the day in harlotrie and other filthy exercise. Whose example yf
they practise, or imitate sutch commendable life as becommeth their
estates, then glory will followe their deedes, as the shadowe doeth the
body. Then welfare and liuelihoode aboundantly shal bee mynistred to
supply want of patrimonie or defect of parents portion. And thus the
Hystory doth begin. Not long sithens Queene Anne, the sister of Lewes,
that was king of Hungarie, and wife to Ferdinando Archeduke of
Austriche, (which at this day is parcel of the kingdome of Hungary and
Boeme,) together with the Lady Mary daughter of Philip kynge of Spayne,
and wife of the sayd Lewes, went to keepe hir abode, and soiorne in
Hispurge, a&nbsp;Countrey among the Dutch very famous, where many tymes
the Court of the Hungarian Prynces longe space remayned. These two Noble
Queenes remained within the Palace of king
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page385" id = "page385">385</a></span>
Maximilian, Emperour at that time elected, which Palace is so neare
adioyning to the Cathedrall Church, as without sight of the people at
their pleasure they mighte by a secrete Gallerie passe to the Church to
heare diuine seruyce accustomably celebrated there. Which vse they dayly
obserued with theyr Ladies and Gentlewomen, and other Lordes and
Gentlemen of the Court. In which church was made and erected a high
place in manner of a Closet gorgeously wrought, and in royall manner
apparelled of sutch amplitude as it was hable to receyue the whole trayn
and company attendant vpon the Persons of the two Quenes. Now it came to
passe that a Gentleman of Cremona in Italy called Philippo di Nicuoli,
whych in those dayes by reason of the recouery of the Duchie of Milane,
by the Frenche, departed Lombardie, and went to Hispurge, and was
Secretarie to Signa Andrea Borgo, bicause he was well learned, and could
wryte very fayre, and therwithall a proper and very haundsome man. This
yong Gentleman very mutch frequenting the Church, and seeing the beauty
of Queene Anne, to excell all the reast of the Ladies, adorned and
garnished with princely behauiour and Queenelyke qualytyes, not
foreseeyng (when hee beheld hir) the nature of loue, whych once being
possessed, neuer leaueth the pacient til it hath infebled his state lyke
the quality of poyson, distillinge through the vaynes, euen to the
heart. Which louing venim this Gentleman did drinke with the lookes of
his eyes, to satisefy and content his desired minde by vewinge and
intentife considering hir wonderful beauty, that rapt beyond measure, he
was myserably intangled wyth the snares of blind and deceiptfull loue,
wherewith he was so cruelly inflamed, as he was lyke to sorte out of the
bounds of reason and Wyt. And the more he did beholde the hyghnesse of
hir Maiesty, and the excellency of so great a Lady, and therewithal did
weigh and consider hys base degree and Lignage, and the poore state
whereunto frowarde fortune that tyme had brought him, the more he
thought hymselfe frustrate and voyde of hope, and the more the perillous
flames of loue did assayle and fire his amorous heart, kindlinge hys
inward partes with loue so deepely ingraffed, as it was impossible to be
rooted out. Mayster Philippo then in this manner (as&nbsp;you haue
heard) knotted and intrapped within the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page386" id = "page386">386</a></span>
fillets and laces of loue, supposing all labour which hee should imploy
to be lost and consumed, throughly bent himselfe with all care and
diligence to atchieue this hygh and honorable enterprise, whatsoeuer
should come of it: whych effectually he pursued. For alwayes when the
Queenes were at church to heare deuine seruice, he fayled not to bee
there. And hauinge done his duetyfull reuerence, whych very comely he
could do, he vsed to bestow himselfe dyrectly ouer agaynst hir: where
delitinge in the beauty of the Queene whych dayly more and more inflamed
his heart, would not depart from thence tyll the Queenes were disposed
to goe. And if perchaunce for some occasion, the Queenes went not to
Church, maister Philippo for all that (were his businesse neuer so great
and needefull) would vouchsafe at least wise to visite the place, where
he was wont to see his Lady. Sutch is the ordinary force of loue that
although liberty of sight and talke be depryued from the pacient, yet it
doeth hym good to treade in the Steps of that Ground where his Mistresse
doth vsually haunt, or to see the place vppon whych she eased hir tender
corps, or leaned hir delicate elbowes. Thys young man bayted, and fed in
amorous Toyes and Deuyses, now armed wyth hope, and by and by disarmed
by despayre, reuolued in hys mynde a thousand thoughts and cogitations.
And although he knew that hys Ladder had not steps inow to clyme so
hygh, yet from his determined purpose hee was not able to remoue: but
rather the more difficult and daungerous hys enterpryse seemed to bee,
the more grew desire to prosecute and obiect hymselfe to all daungers.
If peraduenture the Queenes for their disport and pastime were disposed
to walke into the fieldes or gardens of the Citty of Hispurge, he fayled
not in company of other Courtiers to make one of the troupe, beinge no
houre at rest and quiet if he were not in the sight of Queene Anne, or
neere the place where shee was. At that time there were many Gentlemen
departed from Lumbardy to Hispurge, which for the most part followed the
Lord Francisco Sforza the second, by whom they hoped when the Duchy of
Mylane was recouered, to be restored to their countrey. There was also
Chamberlayne to the sayd Lorde Francesco, one mayster Girolamo Borgo of
Verona betwene whom and mayster Philippo, was very neere freendship and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page387" id = "page387">387</a></span>
familiarity. And bicause it chaunseth very seldome, that feruent loue,
can be kept so secrete and couert, but in some part it will discouer it
selfe, mayster Borgo easily did perceyue the passion wherewith mayster
Philippo was inflamed. And one mayster Philippo Baldo many times being
in the company of mayster Borgo and Philippo, did marke and perceiue his
loue, and yet was ignorant of the truth, or voyde of coniecture with
what Gentlewoman he was inamored. But seeing him contrary to wonted
custome altered, and from vsual mirth transported, fetchinge many sighes
and strayninges from his stomake, and markinge how many times he would
steale from the company he was in, and withdraw himselfe alone, to muse
vppon hys thoughts, brought thereby into a melancholy and meane estate,
hauing lost his sleepe, and stomak of eating meate: iudged that the
amorous Wormes of loue did bitterly gnaw and teare his heart with the
nebs of their forked heades. They three then being vppon a time
together, debatinge of diuers thinges amonges themselues, chaunced to
fall in argument of loue, and maister Baldo, and Borgo, the other
Gentlemen, sayd to mayster Philippo, how they were wel assured that he
was straungly attached with that passion, by marking and considering
that new life, which lately he led contrary to former vse, intreating
him very earnestly, that he would manifest his loue to them, that were
his deere and faythfull frends, tellinge him that as in weighty matters
otherwise he was already sure what they were, euen so in this he might
hardily repose his hope and confidence, promisinge hym all their helpe
and fauour, if therein their indeuour and trauayle might minister ayde
and comfort. Hee then like one raysed from a trance, or lately reuiued
from an extasie, after he had composed his Countenaunce and Gesture,
wyth teares and multitude of sobbes, began to say these woordes: “My
welbeloued freendes, and trusty companions, being right well assured
that yee (whose fidelity I haue already proued, and whose secret mouthes
be recommended amongs the wise and vertuous), will keepe close and
couert the thinge which you shall heare me vtter, as of sutch
importaunce, that if the yong Romane Gentleman Papyrus had been here,
for all his silence of graue matters required by hys Mother,
I&nbsp;woulde vnnethes haue dysclosed the same vnto
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page388" id = "page388">388</a></span>
hym. Indeede I cannot deny, but must needes confesse that I am in loue,
and that very ardently, which I cannot in sutch wyse conceale, but that
the blinde must needes clearely and euidently perceyue. And although my
mouth would fayne keepe close, in what plight my passions do constrayne
my inward affections, yet my face and straung maner of life, which for a
certayne tyme and space I haue led, doe wittnesse, that I am not the man
I was wont to bee. So that if shortly I doe not amend, I&nbsp;trust to
arriue to that ende whereunto euery Creature is borne, and that my
bitter and paynful life shall take ende, if I may call it a lyfe, and
not rather a lyuing death: I&nbsp;was resolued and throughly determined,
neuer to discouer to any man the cause of my cruell torment, being not
able to manifest the same to hir, whom I doe only loue, thinking better
by concealinge it through loue, to make humble sute to Lady Atropos,
that shee woulde cut of the thred of my dolorous lyfe. Neuerthelesse to
you, from whom I ought to keepe nothynge secrete, I&nbsp;wyll
dysgarboyle and vnlace the very Secretes of my Minde, not for that I
hope to finde comfort and reliefe, or that my passions by declaration of
them, will lesson and diminishe, but that yee, knowinge the occasion of
my death, may make report thereof to hir, that is the only mistresse of
my life, that shee vnderstandinge the extreme panges of the truest louer
that euer liued, may mourne and wayle hys losse: which thinge if my
seely Ghost may knowe, no doubt where soeuer it do wander, shall receyue
great ioy and comfort. Be it known vnto you therefore, the first day
that myne Eyes behelde the diuine beauty and incomparable fauor of that
superexcellent Lady Queene Anne of Hungary, and that I (more than
wysedom required) did meditate, and consider the singuler behauiour and
notable curtesie and other innumerable giftes wherewith shee is indued,
the same beyond measure did so inflame my heart, that impossible it was
for me to quench the feruent loue, or extinguish the least parte of my
conceyued torment. I&nbsp;haue done what I can to macerate and mortefie
my vnbridled desire, but all in vayne: My force and puissaunce is weake
to match with so mighty an aduersary. Alas syres, I&nbsp;knowe what yee
will obiect agaynst mee: yee will say that mine ignobility, my byrth and
stocke be no meete
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page389" id = "page389">389</a></span>
matches for sutch a personage, and that my loue is to highly placed, to
sucke reliefe: And the same I do confesse so wel as you. I&nbsp;do
acknowledge my condition and state to base, I&nbsp;confesse that my loue
(nay rather I may terme it folly) doth presume beyond the bounds of
order: For the first tyme that I felt my selfe wrapped in those Snares,
I&nbsp;knewe her to beare the Port amonges the chyefest Queenes, and to
bee the peerelesse Pryncesse of Chrystendome. Agayne, I&nbsp;knew my
selfe the poorest Gentleman of the Worlde, and the most myserable exile:
I&nbsp;thought moreouer it to be very vnseemely for me to direct my
mynde vpon a wight so honorable, and of so great estate: But who can
rayne the Bridle, or prescribe lawes to loue? What is he that in loue
hath free wil and choyse? Truely I beleeue no man, bicause loue the more
it doth seeme to accorde in pleasure and delight, the further from the
mark he shooteth his bolte, hauing no respect to degree or state. Haue
not many excellent and worthy personages, yea Dukes, Emperours and
Kinges, bin inflamed with the loue of Ladies, and Women of base and vile
degree? Haue not most honorable dames, and Women of greatest renoume
despised the honor of theyr states, abandoned the company of theyr
hushands, and neglected the loue of theyr Chyldren, for the ardent loue
that they haue borne to men of inferiour sort? All Historyes be full of
examples of that purpose: The memoryes of our auncestors be yet in fresh
remembraunce, whereof if they were ignorant vnto you that be of great
experience, I&nbsp;could aduouche assured testimony: Yet thus mutch I
say vnto you, that it seeme no newe thing for a man to be ouercome by
his owne affectyon: It is not the Nobility of hir state, or for that
shee is a Queene, it is not the consideration of one parte or other,
that moued me first hereunto: But loue it is, that is of greater force
than we our selues bee of, which many tymes maketh that to seeme
lawfull, which altogether is vnlawful, and by subduing reason maketh the
great potentate lorde tributarie to his wyl and pleasure, whose force is
farre greater then the lawes of Nature. And albeit that I neuer hope to
attayne to prosperous end of this magnifike and stately loue, whych more
and more doth seeme infortunate, yet I can not for my Lyfe else where
apply the same, or alter it to other place: And consumynge still
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page390" id = "page390">390</a></span>
through faithful and feruent loue borne to the Queene, I&nbsp;haue
forced and constrained my self by al possible meanes to gyue ouer that
fond and foolish enterprise, and to place my mynd else where: but mine
endeuour and all my labour and resistance is employed in vayne: Yea and
if it were not for feare of eternall damnation, and the losse of my
poore afflicted soule (which God forbid) myne owne Handes before this
time had ended my desires. I&nbsp;am therefore determined (sith that I
can attaine no successe of Loue, and that God doth suffer me to be
inspyred wyth that most honourable and curteous Lady, beyond all order
and estimation) to content my selfe with the sight of those hir fayre
and glistring eyes, farre excelling the sparcling glimpse of the
Diamonde or Saphire, and to serue, loue and honour hir, so long as life
doth last within this feeble corpes: Vpon whose radiant and excelling
beautie, my hope shall continually feede: and yet I am not so far voyd
of vnderstandinge, but that I do most euidently know none other to be
the guide of thys vnmeasurable loue, but folly most extreme.” Vpon the
end of those words he let fal many teares, and being staied with sobbs
and sighes he was able to speake no more. And in very deede he that had
seene him, would haue thought that his heart had bene tormented with
most bitter and painfull passions. Now they being very attentiue to his
pytifull oration, were attached with incredible sorrow, thinking that
they had ben in a dreame by hearing of this discourse, and stode styll a
while one loking vpon an other, without speaking word: Afterwards
comming to themselues, distraughte almost, for the greate admiration and
wonder to heare him speake those words, mayster Girolamo and Baldo, with
suasible arguments went about to counsell him to withdraw his fonde and
foolysh mind, praying him to place the same elsewhere, shewing him the
impossibility of hys enterpryse, and the great peril that might succeede
thereof. But they spake to a man that seemed to be deaf, who replied,
that hee neither coulde or would giue ouer his loue, that had already
made so depe impression, what so euer came of it: Notwythstandyng they
ceased not still with sharp admonitions to beate into his head, the
fonde begynning of his foolish loue: and not onely at that tyme, but
continually when they were together, they dyd theyr
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page391" id = "page391">391</a></span>
best by oft repetition of his vayne conceipt, to let him vnderstande his
manyfest error: but theyr labour and friendly lessons were to no
purpose: Wherefore mayster Borgo, determined to giue him ouer, and to
attende what would succede therof. Mayster Philippo continuing hys
pursute, neuer faylyng to be at church when he knew the Quenes to be
ther, at length it chanced that they began to espy his loue, for that
both of them did mark his order, gesture and demeanure, and did note his
oft frequentation of the places where they continually haunted and his
manner in placyng himselfe at the church directly ouer agaynst them, and
his common vse in beholding and loking vpon their faces, iudgyng thereby
that without doubt he was in loue with one of them, or at least with
some Gentlewoman of their trayne whereof the two Queenes began to vse
some talk, although not certain vpon whom his loue was bent.
Neuerthelesse they wer desirous to know the troth, and expected
oportunitie somtime to dissolue that doubt. In the meane while maister
Philippo thought by gazing on theyr beauty, to remoue the fire that
miserably did consume the suck and marow of his bones, seking comfort
and relief for his afflicted heart, the more I say he sought for ease,
the greater he felt his payn: And truely all they that feruently do
loue, aspire to that, which otherwise they woulde eschue, by sight of
them whome they do loue, not remembering that the more they doe
contemplate the beloued beauty, the more increaseth desire, and with
desire extreme and bitter smart. Maister Philippo then lost no occasion
or time stil to behold Madame the Queene, were it in the church or
courte, or were she disposed for disport and recreation to walke abrode.
It chaunced now while things wer at this poynt, the ladies very desirous
to know vpon whom maister Philippo did expend his loue, that fortune
opened vnto them a meane to vnderstand the same: It was then about that
time of the yere, wherein al floures and roses were by Titans force
constrained to adorne and decke ech gardens and place of pleasure, and
with their fragrant smells and odors, to sent the same in the moneth of
May: it was when the Twinnes were dysposed to shroud themselues amongs
the hawthorn boughs and honysuckles that yeld to euery wyght greatest
store of delyghts, at what time roses and other floures at
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page392" id = "page392">392</a></span>
theyr first budding be very rare and scant, sauing in Kings Courtes and
prynces Palaces, where sutch rarieties by art and industrie be most
abundant, and all men haue delight to present sutch nouelties to the
pryncipall ladies. Vpon a day Queene Anne had in hir hands certayne
floures in due order couched in a Nosegay, and for hir disport walked vp
and down a very fayre and gorgeous garden, in the company of Queene
Mary, and other Ladies and gentlewomen, about that tyme of the day the
Sun wearie of trauaile, went to hide him self in the back side of the
western mountains, wher amongs other of the Courte was maister Philippo.
Queene Anne when she had espyed him, determined to make proufe with what
Lady amongs them all, mayster Philippo was in loue, and sporting hir
self with softe and prety walkes vp and downe the garden, pleasantly
iesting with diuerse there attendant, (as&nbsp;the maner is of like
Ladies) with trimme and pleasant talk, at length happed vpon maister
Philippo, who although he was in communication with certain Italian
Gentlemen, neuerthelesse his mynde and eyes were fixed vpon the Queene,
that whensoeuer she appeared before him his eyes and face were so
firmelye bent vppon hir, as the beholder might easily perceiue, that the
Vysage of the Quene was the vndoubted harborough of his thought.
Philippo, seeing the Queene come toward him, did honor hir wyth gentle
and dutifull reuerence, in sutch humble wise, as hee seemed at hir hands
pitifully to craue mercy. And truely whosoeuer doth loue with secret and
perfect heart, seemeth to vtter more words to his Lady with his eies,
than he is able to speak wyth his tongue. The Queene being come vnto him
with a grace right graue and demure, sayd vnto him: “You Gentleman of
Lombardie, yf these floures which we haue in our hands were giuen vnto
you liberally to vse at your pleasure, and requyred to make some
curteous present of the same to one of vs the ladies here that liked you
best, tell mee I pray you, to whether of vs would you giue the same, or
what would you do or say? Speake frankely we pray you, and tell youre
mynde wythout respect: for thereby you shall doe to vs very great
pleasure, and we shal know to whether of vs you beare your chiefest
loue. For it is not to be supposed, that you being a young man, can
spende your time without loue, being a naturall quality in euery
creature.”
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page393" id = "page393">393</a></span>
When mayster Philippo felt the swete voyce of the Queene pleasantly to
pierce his eares, and hearde that he was commaunded for the loue of hir
that he loued, not onely to tell whome he loued best and most intierly,
but also hir whom he worshipped and serued in heart, was almost besides
hymselfe, sutch was the ticklyng ioylitie that he felt in hys heart,
whose face was taynted wyth a thousand colors and what for superfluous
loue and ioy, wherof the like he neuer tasted before, fell into an
extasie, not able to render answere. But when he had recouered stomack,
so well as he coulde with soft and trembling voice, he answered the
Queene in this wise: “Sith your maiesty (to&nbsp;whom I yelde myne
humble thanks for that curtesie) hath vouchsafed to commaund me (besides
the infinite pleasure and honour, for which eternally I shal stande
bound to your highnesse) I&nbsp;am ready sincerely and truely to
dysclose my mind, being promised by your maiesty in opening of the same,
to deserue great thanks: Wherfore your pleasure being such I do say
then, with all due reuerence, that not onely here at thys tyme, but at
al times and places wher it shal please god to appoint me, being not
able to bestow them in other sort than they be, but wer they more
precious and fayre, the more ioyfull I should bee of them. These floures
I say shall of me right humbly be presented to your maiesty, not bicause
you be a Queene and of a royal Race (whych notwythstandinge is a great
vertue) but bicause you bee a Phœnix, a&nbsp;rare Lady, and of all the
troupe the fayrest, garnished with infinit gifts, and passinge vertues,
for your merites worthy to be honoured wyth farr more excellent gifts,
than these simple floures be, as she that (aboue all other Ladyes that
liue at this day) is the honour and onely glory of all womanhoode of our
age, as shee that is the Paragon peerelesse of the vniuersal worlde.”
<ins class = "correction" title = "error for ‘When’">when</ins> he had
sayd those words, he held his peace. The Queene with great delight
hearing the ready aunswere of the yong Gentleman, sayd vnto hym: “And we
do giue you thanks for the great honor and commendation done vnto vs.”
When she had sayd so, without further talke, she went forth vsing
pleasant talke and sport with diuers that wayted vpon hir. Queene Anne
now vnderstode, and so likewise Queene Mary, which of them the yong
Lumbard Gentleman did accept for his soueraign
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page394" id = "page394">394</a></span>
Lady, whose loue she disdayned not, but in her mynde rather commended,
esteeming him better than euer she did before: and lyke a discreet and
wyse Lady gaue him infinite prayse. She did not now as other women wont
to do, who when they see themselues of birth more noble, or of degree
more ample than their louers be (whych gift they receyue through the
fauor of the heauens) do not only despise them, but mock them, and their
faythfull seruice, and many tymes with fayned countenance and dissembled
words do extol them and set them vp aloft, and by and by almost with one
breath, exchanging their fayned prayse into rebuke, they thrust them
downe headlong from the tipe of hope and comfort, to the bottomlesse pit
of despayre: and the fuller she is of floutes, the finer Girle esteemed.
But farre better is she to be regarded, that not findinge in hir hart to
loue hir suter, will frankly tell him at the first, that she cannot like
hym, nor fashion hir mynde to loue him, and requiring him not to feede
his minde with vayne hope, or contriue the tyme with words and lookes,
and pray him to seeke some other that can better fansy his person than
she: And although perchance a man do very feruently loue a woman, and
that it wer great sorrow and grief vnto him to bee cast of, and receiue
such refusall, yet in myne opinion it were lesse griefe openly to
receiue that repulse, than to be fawned vppon, and flattered with fained
talke, and for the time choaked with the baite of vaine hope, and
afterwards become ridiculous, and gired by the scorneful. I&nbsp;am
assured, that the woman which giueth hir seruant sutch repulse, shall
bee counted mutch more cruell, than Maistresse Helena was to the
scholler of Paris, after he was returned from the vniuersitie to
Florence, written by Boccaccio in his Decamerone, and hereafter in place
described. But let vs retourne to maister Philippo, who although hee
coulde not imagine ne conceiue the intent, wherfore Queene Anne made
that demaund, yet the same was very deare and acceptable vnto him, vppon
the which he neuer thought, but felt great contentation in his mynd, and
was more iocund and pleasant than he was wont to be before. On the other
side the Queene, which was very discrete and wise, when she saw maister
Philippo at the church or other place to make obeysance vnto hir very
curteously requited the same, bowing hir head to him agayn,

(which she neuer vsed but to Barons and Knights of great reputation)
declaryng thereby how wel in worth she regarded his reuerence made vnto
hir: Whereat he receiued maruellous pleasure and delight, hoping for
none other recompence at hir handes, than continuance of sutch curtesies
and honourable entertaynment. Amongs certayne Italians that were vppon a
Day assembled in the presence chamber of Queene Anne, waiting there vpon
Madonna Barbara the wyfe of Maister Pietro Martire Stampa, who wyth hir
two daughters were gone to salute the two Queenes that were that time
together: There was also maister Philippo, with whom Borgo and Baldo
reasoned of diuerse matters: And as they wer in talke, both the Queenes
came forth, which was the occasion, that al the lords and Gentlemen
attended, vppon whose approch, ech man rose vp, and bareheaded expected
whither the Queenes would goe. Quene Anne perceyuing a company of
Italians together, left Queene Marie, and went streight to them, and
very gently inquyred of dyuerse of the Gentlemen, their names, and of
what partes of Italy they were, then she came to the place where they
<span class = "smallroman">III.</span> were standing together, and
curteously asked first maister Girolamo, what his name was, of what
countrey, whether he were a Gentleman? To whom reuerently he said: “that
his name was Girolamo Borgo, a&nbsp;Gentleman of Verona.” Mayster Baldo
likewise being demaunded the same, answered so well as he coulde: “that
he was a Gentleman borne, of an auncient house in Milane, and that his
name was Philippo Baldo.” When she had receiued theyr answere with
cheereful and smiling countenance she returned to maister Philippo,
inquyryng of him also his name and countrey, and whether he were a
Gentleman or not? Whom maister Philippo after his duety done reuerently
answered: “Madame, my souerain Lady and only mistresse, I&nbsp;am a
Gentleman, and am called by the name of Philippo dei Nicuoli, of
Cremona.” The Queene making no further demaundes of any of the other
Gentlemen, sayd to Mayster Philippo: “You say true sir, I&nbsp;dare
warrant you to be a Gentleman in deede, and hee that sayd the contrary,
should declare himself to be voyd of Iudgement what a Gentleman is.” She
sayde no more, but from thence with Queene Mary and the whole trayne she
went to Church. All they that hard the Queene speake those
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page396" id = "page396">396</a></span>
words, dyd wonder, and could not deuise what shee meant by them,
notwithstanding ech man thought that the Queene bare to maister Philippo
singuler good will and fauour. He (as&nbsp;it was his custome) full of
diuerse cogitations, whose head was building of great cities, went to
church, bestowing himselfe in his wonted place, reuoluing in hys mind
the Queene’s words spoken vnto him. And although he could not perceiue
to what end that honorable lady had spoken them, yet hee thought that
hir maiesty had done him great honour. And verily the humanity and
curtesy of a Lady, so excellent and noble is worthy to be extolled with
infinite prayses, who being of high estate and lineage, and the wife of
a Prince that proceded of the stirpe Imperial, not only did not disdaine
to be beloued of a man of so base degree, and banished from his own
Country, but also with great care and diligence did deuise, and in
effect declare that she was the same whome the Italian yong gentleman
did loue as partly it was euidently to bee perceiued, not for other
purpose doubtlesse, but to do some Noble deede couenable for the
greatnesse of hir estate, and incident to the feruent loue of the
amorous yong Gentleman, which afterwardes in very dede she accomplyshed.
But howe many be there in these dayes, I&nbsp;doe not speake of Queenes
and Pryncesses, but of simple and priuate Gentlewomen, that beyng of
meane worship, indued with some shew of beautie, be without good
conditions and vertue, who seeyng themselues beloued of some Gentlemen,
not so enriched with the goods of Fortune as they be, do scorne and
mocke them, thynking themselues to good to be loked vpon, or to be once
moued of vertuous loue, scornfully casting their face at one side, as
though the suters were vnworthy their company? Howe many likewyse be
possessed and ouerwhelmed with pryde by reason Nature more propicious
vnto them then other, be descended of some great parentage, that will
accompt a great iniurie done vnto them, if any gentleman except he be
rych, do make sute to loue them? Again a great number of women
(I&nbsp;speake of them whose minds do not so mutch aspire to fame or
honour as they seeke their delights and brauerie to be mainteined) bee
of this trampe, that they care not whether theyr louers bee discrete,
well condicioned, vertuous and gentle, so that
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page397" id = "page397">397</a></span>
theyr pursses be full of money, or theyr shapes amiable, not waying the
valour and good conditions of the minde, ne yet a thousand other
qualities that ought to garnish a Gentleman, whereby all vertuous
Gentlemen dayly do growe beautiful, and be enriched wyth greater
perfections. Some there be that fixe their minds vpon those, that be of
goodly personage, although void of good behauiour, louing rather a piece
of flesh with two eyes, than an honest man well furnished with vertue.
Thynk not yet for all thys, that herein men ordinarily bee more wyse
than women, althoughe they ought to bee accomplished with greater witte:
but to say the truth, they all be spotted with one kind of pitch, that
warfare here in the large campe of this present worlde: whereof it
commeth to passe, that light loue as we see to beare no good foundation,
and to haue no longe continuance, euen so the end and conclusion to
consume like the beauty of the floure. And therupon many times it
chaunceth, that when loue is not grounded but vpon transitorie beauty,
which doth dissolue like a windy cloude, the little heat thereof doth
not wax more hote, but rather congealeth to frost, and many times
conuerteth into hatred and mischiefe most cruel. A&nbsp;worse thing yet
than this is in common practise: There be many that wyll needes bee
counted and called gentlemen, bycause they come of Auncient and Noble
race, and being growen vp to man’s state, doe appeare in shapes of men,
but are altogether without approued manners, vtterly ignorant what the
nature of Gentle is, accomptyng themselues to be ioly fellowes, when in
company of other as bigge beastes as them selues, they contriue theyr
time and make their bragges, vaunting that Sutch a woman is at my
commaundment, and sutch a man’s wyfe I do keepe, sutch a one is my
companion’s friende: whereby they bryng many women, yea and of the best
sort, into slaunder and infamie. Diuerse Gentlewomen also bee so fond,
and of so simple discretion, that although they know and clearely
perceyue thys to be true, yet allured with the personages and beauty of
sutch Roisters, passe not to giue the rayne to these vnbridled Iades,
not foreseeing (lyke ignorant Woodcockes) that in fewe dayes through
their own temeritie, they incur the common shame of the vulgar people,
being pointed at in the streates as they goe: where sutch as be wyse and
discrete, doe
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page398" id = "page398">398</a></span>
dayly feare the least suspition that may be conceiued. There is no woman
that is wyse, but so neare as she can, wil shunne and auoyde all
occasion whereby slaunder may aryse, and will chose vnto hit amongs a
number, sutch one as can best please hit fansie, and as with whome for
hys vertue and honesty she purposeth to match hir selfe in maryage,
which is the final ende of all honest loue. Howe be it Nature hath not
framed euery creature of one metall, ne yet Minerua infused lyke brayne
into euery head. And truely this our age dothe breede many fayre and
worthie Women, whose condicions bee good and honest, adorned with comely
qualities, the Generositie, stoutnesse and Valoure of whose myndes doe
deserue syngular prayse and estymatyon. And what is hee, chauncynge
vppon a curteous and Vertuous Dame, that wyll not gyue ouer the Loue of
all other, to honour and loue hir for euer? But wee haue digressed too
long from our Hystorye, and therefore, retourning to the same agayne,
I&nbsp;say, that Fortune the guide of maister Philippo, was fully
determined to bestow hir fauor vpon him: For besides that the Queene
dearely estemed his loue, it seemed that all thyngs wer vnyted and
agreed to sort his enterpryse to happy successe. The Queene had to her
Gouernesse Madonna Paola dei Cauali, a&nbsp;Gentlewoman of Verona, very
auncient and graue (aduaunced to the callyng, by Madonna Bianca Maria
Sforza the wyfe of the Emperour Maximilian) whom Queene Anne requyred
dylygently to procure for hir, sutch Rithmes in the Thuscane language
and other Italian workes, as were to be found, bicause hir dysposition
was to be conuersant and familiar in that tongue, and employed great
diligence to learne and exercise the same, wherein shee attained sutch
perfection, as all Italians coulde very well vnderstande her. Now
(as&nbsp;the good lucke of mayster Philippo woulde haue&nbsp;it) he that
day went to the Courte alone, continuallye deuisinge if it were
possible, at al tymes to be in presence of the Quene: Whome so soone as
Madonna Paola espyed, bicause she familiarly knew him went vnto him, and
sayd: “My welbeloued friend maister Philippo, bicause the Queene hath
great delight to learn our tongue, and therein already hath some
towardnesse, as by hir common speakying of the same you may perceyue,
this mornyng at hir vprising shee gaue me a great
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page399" id = "page399">399</a></span>
charge to procure for hir, certayne Italian Rithmes, who besides those
bookes in that tongue already prynted, gladly desireth to see some
trymme deuises of diuerse learned men that make in oure <ins class =
"correction" title = "punctuation and capitalization unchanged">Daies.
specially</ins> hir mind is earnestlye disposed vpon Rithmes cunningly
composed, whereof I thinke you haue some store by reason of your delight
in that exercise: Wherefore I thought good to repayre vnto you, and doe
heartily pray you, to make hir Maiesty pertaker of sutch as you haue,
wherein you shal do hir great and grateful seruice, and I shal remain
continually bound vnto you: besides that I doe purpose when I present
them vnto hir, to make hit priuie that I receyued them at your hands,
which bicause of the loue shee beareth to our Natyon, she wyl fauorably
accept, and the same no doubte when opportunitye serueth, liberally
reward.” Maister Philippo in curteous wise thanked the gentlewoman, and
said, that he was sorry he was not able better to satisefie hir request,
bicause in that countrey he had small store of sutch desired things,
neuerthelesse he would make diligent search, to get so many as were
possible to be found, either amongs the Gentlemen that folowed the
Court, or else where they were to be gotten. In the meane time, he sayd,
that he would deliuer those few hee had, and bring them vnto hir that
night, praying hir to commend hym to the good grace, and fauour of hir
maiesty. And so he tooke hys leaue, and went strayght to hys Lodging,
where diligently he began to search among his writings (the gladdest man
in the Worlde for that occasion offered) and founde amonges the same
diuers rithmes which hee thought vnworthy to passe into the handes of so
great a Lady, sauing the third Rithme or Chapter, as we commonly call
it, made by a notable Doctor of the lawes, and excellent Poet called
M.&nbsp;Niccolo Amanio, of Crema, who no doubt for making of vulgar
rithmes, thereby expressing the amorous affections of Louers, was in our
time without comparison. And bicause the same was so apt for the purpose
of mayster Philippo his loue, as could be desired, he wrote the same
fayre (being in deede a very fayre sheete of Paper,) which soundeth to
this effect.</p>

<p>When Mayster Philippo had written out these verses, immediately he
returned to the court, and caused Madona Paolo, to be called vnto him by
one of the Gromes of the Chamber, to whom he sayd: “Maystresse Paola,
I&nbsp;haue brought you a ditty, that is very trim and prety, which I
pray you deliuer to the Queene, and I will do what I can to get other.”
Maistresse Paola tooke them, and went into the chamber, and findinge the
Queene alone, sayd to hir: “Madame, this morninge yee commaunded me to
get you some
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page401" id = "page401">401</a></span>
Italian Rithmes, and vpon inquirie I haue receyued these few verses of
mayster Philippo, secretary to the Lord Andrea Borgo, who hath promised
to bring me other.” The Queene hearing hir speake those words, smilinge
receiued the Paper, and read the same: the sense whereof she liked very
well, thinking that mayster Philippo had bene the compositor of the
same, and that of purpose he had made them for hir, whereby shee was out
of doubt that it was shee that mayster Philippo so feruently loued, and
the better hir opinion was confirmed, bicause some of the words tended
to the state of hir personage. And considering the valor of hys minde,
she praysed Nature, for that in a man so basely borne shee had sowen the
seeds of a gentlemanlike and noble heart, greatly to hir selfe
commendynge the yong man. Then she conferred the whole matter wyth hir
Coosin Queene Marie: which was a wyse and comely Ladye, and vpon that
loue they vsed many discourses, more and more hauing in regard the
behauiour of that yong Gentleman. Queene Anne determined, when
conueniently shee might, to rendre to mayster Philippo, for his great
loue condigne rewarde: and studying still how to requite his curtesie,
euer when she saw maister Philippo, shee vsed him with her wonted chere
and grateful salutation (which thinge onely euery honest gentleman ought
to expect that is indued wyth reason at the hands of a pryncesse so
noble and worthy, as a reward sufficient, the inequality of the parties
considered.) Whereof mayster Philippo was the best contented man of the
world, and durst not hope for greater guerdon, continuing his wonted
lyfe fed hym self stil with that beloued sight, in sutch wyse as many
Gentlemen enuied the fauor borne vnto him by the Queene, who for none
other cause did vse that curtesy, but for that she saw him to be
Vertuous and well learned: continually esteemyng sutch as wyth learning
or other gyftes of the mynd were indewed: and when occasion chaunced,
shee vouchesafed to bestowe vpon them curteous intertaynment and
lyberall rewardes. It fortuned about that time that the Emperor
Maximilian died, Charles his nephew (which was the Emperor Charles, the
fifth,) then beyng in Spayne, by reason of whose death the Lord Andrea
Borgo, purposed to send one of hys Gentlemen to kyng Charles,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page402" id = "page402">402</a></span>
for the confirmation of that lyuing he enioyed, giuen vnto him for his
long and faythfull seruyce by the said Maximilian. Amongst al he chose
this maister Philippo, for his wisdome and experience in sutch affayres.
Which don, he went to the Queenes, and gaue them to vnderstand that
shortely he would send his Secretarie into Spayne, and told them the
cause, humbly praying them both, that they would write their fauorable
letters in his behalf. The Queenes knowing what payne and trauell hee
had sustayned in the seruice of Maximilian, and what daungers he had
passed, were very willing therunto. Now Queene Anne remembred that she
had conuenient time to recompence maister Philippo for hys long loue
born vnto hir: and bicause she was the most curteous Lady of the world,
and therwithal most bountifull and liberal, and not onely with comely
talke and gesture: but also in effecte willing to do them good, whome
she honoured in minde, concluded what to do, requiring the Lord Andrea
to send his Secretarie vnto hir, when he was ready to depart, for that
besides Letters, she woulde by mouth commit certain businesse for hir to
do in the Courte of Spayne. When the Lord Andrea was gone, Queene Anne
began to deuise with the other Queene what she mighte doe for mayster
Philippo, who prayed Queene Anne, after she had commended him in
letters, to suffer hir to make the ende and conclusion of the same.
Whereupon both the Queenes wrote many letters into Spayne, to king
Charles, and to the Lord Chancellour and other Noble men, whome they
thought to bee apte and mete ministers to bring the effect of their
letters to passe. When the Lord Andrea had put all thinges in order for
that dispatch, he sayd to mayster Philippo, (which was now furnished
with all thyngs necessary and apertinent for that long voyage:)
“Philippo, remembre this day that you goe to Quene Anne, and tell her,
that I require you to come vnto hir, to know if she would commaund you
any seruice to the Catholike Kynge, where you shall humbly offer your
seruice, in what it pleaseth hir to commaunde: you shall also tel hir
what things I haue gyuen vnto you in charge by speciall commission.”
Neuer could more pleasant talke found into the eares of maister
Philippo, than this, who for that he should bothe see and speake vnto
his Lady before his
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page403" id = "page403">403</a></span>
departure, and for that she would commit vnto him the doing of hir
affayres in Spayne, was the gladdest and best contented man of the
world. The houre come when he thought good to repayre to the Queene, he
went vnto hir, and gaue hir to vnderstand by one of the priuy Chamber,
that he was attendant there to know hir pleasure. The Quene certyfied of
his readinesse to depart, by and by toke order that he should come into
hir chambre, who entring the same with trembling heart, and after he had
done hys humble reuerence, with great feare and bashfulnesse, said:
“Pleaseth your Maiesty, that my Lorde Borgo, being about to addresse mee
hys Secretarie into Spayne, to the Catholike King there, hath commaunded
me to wayte vpon your hyghnesse, to knowe your pleasure for certain
affayres to be don for your maiesty: Wherfore may it please the same to
employ mee, your humble seruaunte, I&nbsp;shall thinke my self the
happiest man of the world: A&nbsp;thing so blessed and ioyfull vnto me,
as no benefite or commoditie can render vnto me greater felicitie.” Then
he dysclosed vnto her thee rest of his message, which was committed vnto
hym by his lord and maister. The Queene beholding hym wyth mery
countenaunce gently sayd vnto hym: “And we for the trust we haue in you
to do our message and other affayres in Spayne, haue requyred you to
come hither: And bycause we knowyng you to be a Gentleman, and assured
that you wyll gladly do your endeuour in any thing that may do vs
pleasure, haue chosen you aboue any other. Our wyl and commaundement is,
that fyrst you delyuer these letters, conteining matters of great
importance to the hands of the catholike King, and that you do our
humble commendations to his maiesty. Then al the rest accordingly as
they be directed, which principally aboue other things we pray you to
dispatch vpon your arriuall: And if we bee able to do you any pleasure,
eyther for your preferment, or for other commodity, spare not to write
vnto vs your mynd, and (we&nbsp;doe assure you) the same shalbe
efectually accomplyshed, to the vttermoste of our indeuour, whych we do
of our owne motion frankely offre vnto you, in consideration of the
fidelitie, worthinesse, and honeste behauiour alwayes knowen to be in
you.” Mayster Philippo hearynge these wordes was replenyshed with sutch
ioy, as he thought hymselfe rapt into
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page404" id = "page404">404</a></span>
the heauens, and his heart felt sutch pleasure, as it semed to flote in
some depe sea of delights: and after the best maner he coulde, thanked
hir for hir curtesie: and albeit (he&nbsp;sayd) that hee knew hymself
vnworthy of that fauor, yet he dedicated the same to hir commaundement,
surrendring himselfe as a slaue and faythful seruant to hir maiesty.
Then vppon his knees, to his great contentation he kissed hir hands,
which of hir selfe she offred vnto him, and then reuerently he toke his
leaue. When hee was gone oute of the chamber, he met with the Queene’s
Coferer, that attended for him, who taking him aside, did put into his
hand a purse with 500. crowns, and the maister of the horsse presented
vnto him a very goodly and beautifull horse, wherewith maister Philippo
was so well pleased, as he was like to leape out of his skin for ioy.
Then he toke his iorney and arriued at the Courte in Spayne, where at
oportunity, he deliuered his Letters to King Charles, and accomplished
other busines and message prescribed vnto him by Quene Anne: And when he
had dispatched the Queene’s other letters, he attended the businesse of
his Lord Andrea Borgo. The king perused the Contentes of the letters
sent vnto him by his sister and kynswoman, so did the Lord Chauncellour,
(which at that time was the Lord Mercurino Gattinara,) and other, to
whom the Queenes had written: whereby the king was solicited to stand
good Lord, to the Lorde Andrea Borgo, and likewise exhorted him to be
beneficial to mayster Phylippo, whom for his good condicions and
experience they had sent vnto him in the ambassage. Vpon a day the king
moued by the Lorde Chancellor, caused maister Philippo to come before
him, to whom kneling before his maiesty, the king said these words: “The
testimony and report so honorably made of you by the two Queenes, from
whom you brought vs letters, and the hope which we haue to find you a
faithful and profitable seruant, and to be correspondent in effecte to
the tenor of those letters, moueth vs to accepte you into the numbre of
one of our Secretaries, wherein before our presence you shal sweare vnto
vs to be faithfull and true.” Maister Philippo that expected for no
sutch dignity, maruelled at the Kyng’s wordes, and there by oth
ministred vnto hym by the Lorde Chauncellour was receyued into his
seruice, and exercysed that
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page405" id = "page405">405</a></span>
office, in singular fauor of the King, to the great satysfaction of al
men. And after that King Charles was elected Emperor, knowing the
experience that maister Philippo had in the affaires of Italy, and
specially in Lombardie, he commytted vnto hym all matters touchyng the
state of the region, which so happily came to passe to maister Philippo,
as besides the ornaments of vertue and wisedom, he acquyred greate
riches, and yet he continually serued and worshipped the Queene as his
noble patronesse and worthy mystresse. Tel me now ye faire Ladies and
Gentlewomen! What shall we say of the princely behauiour and noble
disposition of this Queene? Truly in my iudgment, she deserueth that
prayse and commendation that may be attributed to the moste excellente
Ladye of the Worlde, who neuer gaue ouer her faythful seruant tyl she
had bountifully with hir own hands and commendation, rendred vnto hym a
most Pryncely rewarde. And as the funne in beautye and bryghtnesse doeth
surmounte the other furniture of the Skies, euen so Magnyfycence, and
liberality in ech Lady doth excell all other vertues, specially in those
personages, that keepe the state of Princes. But to conclude, mete and
requisite it is, that yee beautify this most curtuous and liberall
Queene wyth due prayses: For surely in my iudgement, if all Women would
confer theyr heades and Wittes together, and deuise Hymnes and Sonnets
of Liberality, they can neuer sufficiently be able to celebrate the
prayse and glory of thys Queene.</p>

armies of mighty Monarchs. And sutch whilom the cities of Rome, Athenes,
Sparta, and the auncient Monarchs of the Medes, Persians, and the
Assyrians did see. I&nbsp;wil omit a good company of the sage and wyse,
which haue appaysed the troubles of Citties, the inquietations of
Palaces, the cries of Iudgement seates, the dissimulation and
deceiptfull flatteries of Courts, the carefull griefs which the
householder by gouernment of his house and family doth sustaine and
feele, of purpose more frankly to retire to the study of sapience, which
alone is able to make a man happy, and worthy to be partaker of the
diuinity. But aboue al, I&nbsp;wil prayse him which not subiect to the
law lyueth neuerthelesse like him that is most thrall thereunto, or
without respect of bloude or frendship shall exercise Iustice vpon his
dearest and best beloued: as in olde time Manlius and Torquatus at Rome,
the people of Athenes towards

one Timagoras, who beyond the duty of the Ambassador of a frank citty,
fel down on his knees and worshipped the Persian king. And in our time
the Marquize of Ferrara, by doing to death his own son for adultry
committed wyth his mother in Law. And yet Iustice may fauour of some
cruelty, which rather turneth to shame than praise: as Ihon Maria
Visconte Duke of Milan, when he caused a couetous priest to be buried
quick with the corps of him whom he had refused to bury without money,
the history wherof is hereafter remembred. So as mediocrity of
punishment ought to be yoked with the rigor of law, for the mitigation
thereof. And beholde, wherefore the great Dictator Iulius Cæsar loued
better to gayn the heart of his enemies with mercy, than vanquish and
bring them to obedience with massy manacles and giues of Iron. Moreouer
in our age Alphonsus of Aragon (the true Sampler of a iust and Righteous
Prynce) dyd not hee esteeme (when hee strayghtly besieged Gaiette) the
Vyctory to be more Gloryous and better gotten, which is done by
composition and gentlenesse, than the bloudy conquest, colored wyth
teares and bloud of a poore simple people? And truly princes, and great
lordes, specially they which newly (without succession receyued from
their ancestors) arriue to the gouernment of some commonwealth, ought
continually to haue before their eies, an honest seuerity for the
holines of the law, and a graue mildnesse, to moderat the rigour of
their duety: For by that meanes right is mainteined, the heart of man is
won, so wel as by violence: and the state of gouernment taketh so good
footing, as the winde of no sedition afterwards can remoue the same,
beinge founded vpon a sure stone, and framed vpon a rock durable for a
long tyme. Whereof wee haue an example of fresh memory of a kinde act,
full both of wysedome and of gentle seuerity, in a prynce of our time,
who wythout effusion of bloud punished with rigor enough,
a&nbsp;trespasse committed, and sweetely remitted the payne vpon him,
which merited grieuous, nay mortall punishment, as at large you shall
see by the discourse that followeth. Alexander de Medices, fauoured by
the Church of Rome, (and armed with the Papall standard) was hee that
first with great actiuity and Wisedome inueyed the Seniory of Florence,
immediatly vsurping the name, title, and prerogatiue of Duke. The same
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page408" id = "page408">408</a></span>
albeit vpon the prime face he was odious to the people of Florence,
wroth for losing of their ancient liberty, and displeasant to the
Senatours and potentates, to see them selues depriued of the soueraignty
of Iustice, and of the authority they had to commaund ouer all the
Citizens, yet for all that was he indued wyth so good qualities, and
gouerned so wel his principality, as that which at the beginning was
termed Tyranny, was receyued as iust domination, and that which was
supposed to be abused by force, seemed to be done as it were by lawfull
succession. And they counted themselues happy (when they saw their lucke
to bee sutch as their common wealth must needs obey the aduice and
pleasure of one Prince alone) to haue a soueraygn lord, so wise, so
vertuous and so ful of curtesie: and albeit in all other things he
shewed himselfe prayse worthy, noble, and of gentle kinde, yet in this
he vanquished himselfe in himselfe, by that indifferent iustice, which
made him wonderful, denying the same to none, and in no one iote shewed
himselfe parcial to any, which thought by hym to bee supported in their
follies: And that which is more to bee wondred in him, and doth augment
the prayse of his integrity in iudgement, was, that he punished in
another the thynge, which hee ought to haue pardoned and remitted, hee
hymselfe beinge attaynted wyth that dysease. But thys good Duke applyed
to Reason, to tyme, and to the Grauity of the fact and quality of the
offended persones: For where the greatnesse of a deede surpasseth all
occasion of pardon and mercye, there the Prynce, Iudge, or Magistrate
ought to dispoyle and put of his sweetest affections, to apparell
himselfe with rigor, whych reacheth the knyfe into the hand of the
Ruler, of purpose that pryuate familiaritie, do not in ende rayse in the
subiect’s hearte a contempte of superiours, and unbrydled licence,
lawlesse to liue at their pleasure. Now the thing which I meane to tell,
consisteth in the proofe of a rare and exquisite Prynce, which seldome
or neuer harboureth in yong age, the heates whereof can not but with
greate difficultie, feele the coldnesse and correction of reason: And
likewise the causes from whence wisdome’s force proceede, do rest in
longe experience of things, whereby men waxe olde in ripenesse of witte,
and theyr deedes become worthy of prayse. This Duke Alexander ordred so
wel his estates, and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page409" id = "page409">409</a></span>
kepte sutch a goodly and plentifull Court, as the same gaue place to no
Prynce of Italy, how great or rich so euer it was, which noble court he
kept aswell for his owne garde and honor as to shew the naturall
stoutnesse of his corage, not vsing for all that any insolencie or
vnseemely dealing agaynste the haynous and auncient enemies of his
familie. Amongs his gallant troupe of Courtiers, which ordinarily
attended, there was a Florentine gentleman, very neare the Duke, and the
beste beeloued of them all. This yong Gentleman had a Manor hard by
Florence, where he was very well and stately lodged, which caused him
many times to forsake the City, wyth two of his companions, to recreate
himself in that pleasant place. It chaunced vpon a time, he being in his
fieldish house, besides the which there was a Myll, the maister of the
sayd Myll had a passing fayre daughter, whom thys Gentleman did well
marke and beholde, and with hir beauty beecame straungely in loue, in
whom also appeared some Noble port, that exceded the bloud and race
whereof she came. But what? The heauens be not to spare distributers of
theyr gifts, but sometimes they diuide them with the least measure, and
at some other times in equall weight or greatest heape, to them that be
of the basest sorte and popular degree, so wel, as to the greatest and
of most noble race. Rome somtimes hath seen a bondman and slaue,
somtimes a Runnegate’s sonne, for his wit and Courage to beare the
Scepter in his hand, and to decide the causes of that lofty people, who
by sleyghts and practises aspired the Empyre of the whole worlde. And he
that within our Fathers remembrance desireth to knowe what great
Tamberlane of Tartarie was, the astonishment and ruine of al the East
partes, shall well perceyue that his originall sorted from the vulgar
sorte, and from the lowest degree that was amongs all estates: whereby
must be confessed, that the goodnesse of nature is sutch and so great,
as she will helpe hir nourice children (whatsoeuer they&nbsp;be,) the
best she can: Not that I meane to infer hereby, but that the bloud of
Predecessors, with the institution of their Posterity, mutch augmenteth
the force of the spirit, and accomplisheth that more sincerely whereunto
nature hath giuen a beginninge. Now to com to our purpose, this yong
Courtier, taken and chayned in the bands of loue, settred and
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page410" id = "page410">410</a></span>
clogged wyth the Beauty and good grace of that Countrey wench,
forethought the meanes how he myght inioy the thynge after which hee
hoped. To loue hir he deemed it vnworthy of his degre: And yet he knew
hir to be sutch (by&nbsp;report of many) as had a very good Wit, tongue
at wyll, and which is more esteemed, a&nbsp;Paragon and mirror of chaste
life and modesty. Which tormented this amorous Mounsier beyond measure,
and yet chaunged not his affection, assuring himselfe that at length he
should attayne th’ end of his desires, and glut that his vnsatiable
hunger, which pressed him from day to day to gather the soote and
sauorous frute which Louers so egerly sue for at maydens handes of
semblable age, who then was betweene <span class =
"smallroman">XVI.</span> and <span class = "smallroman">XVII.</span>
yeares. This Louer dyd to vnderstand to hys companions his griefe and
frensie, who sory for the same, assayed by all meanes, to make him
forget it, telling hym that it was unseemely for a Gentleman of his
accompt, to make himselfe a fable to the people, which woulde come to
passe if they knew how vndiscretely hee had placed hys loue: and that
there were a number of fayre and honest gentlewomen more to whom besides
conuenably and with greater contentation he might addresse the same. But
he which mutch lesse saw, than blind loue himselfe that was his guid,
and he that was more bare of reason and aduice than the Poets fayne
Cupido to be naked of apparell, would not harken to the good counsel,
which his companions gaue him, but rather sayd that it was lost time for
them to vse sutch spech, for he had rather dy, and indure all the mocks
and scoffs of the world, than lose the most delicate pray (in&nbsp;his
mynde,) that could chaunce into the hands of man, adding moreouer, that
the homelynesse and rudenes of the country, had not so mutch anoyed his
new beloued, but she deserued for hir beauty to be compared with the
greatest Minion and finest attyred gentlewoman of the Citty: For this
mayden had but the ornament and mynionnesse which nature had enlarged,
where other artificially force by trumperies, to vsurpe that which the
heauens deny them. “Touching her vertue let that passe in silence,
sithens that she” (quod he sighinge) “is to chast and vertuous for one
whom I would choose to daly withal: My desire is not to make hir a
Lucrece, or some of those auncient Matrones, which in elder yeres
builded
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page411" id = "page411">411</a></span>
the temple of woman’s Fortune at Rome.” The companions of this louer
seeing how he was bent, promised him what they were able to doe, for
accomplishment of his will, for the which he thanked them very heartely,
offring like duty, where fortune should prepare the proofe of their
affection and neede of his amorous seruice: In the mean time, conceiuing
in his minde some new deuice, which so soone as he had found out was not
able to be brought to passe, and knowing that the duke seldome would
haue him out of his sight, began to inuent lyes, doing hym to vnderstand
that he had necessary occasion, for a certain time, to remain and be at
his country house. The duke which loued him, and who thought that either
he had som secret sicknes, or els som wench which he was loth to
discouer before his companions, gaue him leaue for a month, which so
pleased this amorous Gentleman, as he lept for ioye, and was not able to
rest one hour before he had found out his frends and companions, to
mount on horsback to visit hir that had vnder hir power and obeisance
the best portion of him, which was his hart and his most secret thought.
When he was come to his Countrey house, hee began to stalke abrode, and
daunce a round about the Mill, where his beloued did dwel, who was not
so foolish, but by and by suspected whereunto those goings and commings
of the Pilgrim tended, and for what pray he led his Dogs in lease, and
caused so many Nets and Cords to be displayed by hunters of euery age
and sexe, who to discouer the Countrey, assayde by beating the Bushes,
to take the Beaste at forme: For which cause she also for hir part,
began to fly the snares of those Byrders, and the raunging of the Dogs
that vented after hir, strayinge not from the house of the good man hir
Father: whereof this poore louer conceyued great dispayre, not knowinge
by what meanes he might rouse the Game after which he hunted, ne finde
the meanes to do hir vnderstand his playnts and vnmeasured griefe of
heart, the firme loue, and sinceere mynde wherewyth he was so earnestly
bent, both to obay and loue hir aboue all other: And that which most of
all increased his payne, was that of so great a troupe of messages whych
he had sent, with giftes and promisses the better to atchieue his
purpose, no one was able to take place or force (neuer so little) the
chastity of that sober and modest mayde. It
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page412" id = "page412">412</a></span>
chaunced one day as this Gentleman was walking a long a wode side newly
felled, hard adioyning to his house, by whych there was a cleare and
goodly fountayne shadowed betweene two thick and lofty Maple trees, the
Myller’s Daughter went thither for water, and as she had set downe hir
payles vpon the fountaine brink, hir Louer came vnto hir, litle thinking
of sutch a ioyful meeting, which he wel declared by these words:
“Praysed be God, that when I hoped least of this good hap, he hath sent
me hither, to see the onely substaunce of my ioy.” Then turninge his
face towards the mayden, sayd vnto her: “Is it true that thou art heere
(or&nbsp;do I dreame) and so neare to him that most desireth to gratyfie
thee in any thynge wherewyth it may please thee to commaunde him? Wilt
thou not haue pity vpon the paynes and griefs which continually I indure
for the extreme loue I beare thee?” And saying so, he would haue
imbraced hir. But the mayde, which cared no more for his flatteries,
than before she did for his presents and messages seeing the same to
tend to nothing else but to hir ruine and great dishonor, wyth stout
countenaunce, and by hir liuely colour declaring the chast and vertuous
motion of her bloud, sayd to this valiant Gentleman: “How now, syr, do
you thinke that the vilenesse of myne apparell, holdeth lesse vertue,
than is vnder the rich and sumptuous Ornaments of greatest Ladyes? Do
you suppose that my bringing vp hath bred in me sutch grose bloud, as
for your only pleasure, I&nbsp;shoulde corrupt the perfection of my
minde, and blot the honour which hitherto so carefully I haue kept and
religiously preserued? Be sure that sooner death shall separate the
soule from my body, than willingly I would suffer the ouerthrow and
violation of my virginity. It is not the part of sutch a Gentleman as
you be, thus to espy and subtlely pursue vs poore Countrey maydens to
charme vs with your sleights and guilfull talke: It is not the duety of
a Gentleman to subborne sutch vaunte currors to discouer and put in
perill, the honour of chaste maydens and honest Wyues, as heretofore you
haue done to me. It ought to suffice, that you haue receyued shame by
repulse of your messengers, and not to come your selfe to bee partaker
of their Confusion.” “And that is it, that ought to moue you sweete
heart” (aunswered&nbsp;he) “to take pitty vpon my griefe, so playnly
seeing that vnfaynedly I doe
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page413" id = "page413">413</a></span>
loue you, and that my loue is so well planted, as rather had I suffer
death, than occasion the least offence that may displease you: Only I
beseech you, not to shew your selfe so cruel vnto him, who disdayning
all other, hath made you so frank an offer both of himselfe and of al
that he hath to commaund.” The maide not greatly trusting his words,
feared that he prolonged time to make hir stay till hys seruants came to
steale hir away: And therefore without further aunswere, she taking vp
hir payles, and half running till she came neere the Myll, escaped his
hands, telling hir father no part of that talk betwene them: who began
already to doubt the treason, deuised by the Gentleman, agaynst the
pudicity of his daughter, vnto whom he neuer disclosed his suspition,
were it that he knew hir to be vertuous inough, and constant to resist
the luring assaults of loue, or considred the imbecillity of our flesh,
and the malice of the same, which dayly aspireth things thereunto
defended, and by lawes limitted and prescribed, which lawes it ought not
to excede, and yet therof it wisheth the abolishment. The Gentleman
seeinge that the mayden had forsaken hym, and little esteemed hys
amorous onset, outraged for loue, and chased wyth choler, spake these
wordes to hymselfe: “Ah foolish and dastard louer, what didst thou meane
when thou hadst hir so neere thee, in place so commodious, where shee
durst not gaynesay thee that thou didst no better pursue hir? And what
knowest thou if shee came of purpose to ease thy payne and to finish thy
troublesome trauels? Surely I suppose she did so, but that shame and
duety forced hir to vse those wordes, to make mee thinke, that lyghtly
she would not bee ouercome by persuasions: And put the case that it were
not so, who coulde haue let mee to take by force that, whereunto
willingly she would not accorde: But what is she to be reuenged of sutch
an iniury? She is for conclusion the daughter of a Miller, and may make
hir vaunte, that she hath mocked a Gentleman, who beinge alone wyth hir,
and burninge wyth loue, durst not staunch hys thirst (although full dry)
so neere the fountayne: And by God (sayd he rising from a greene banke
neere the fountayne’s side) if I dy therefore, I&nbsp;wyll haue it
eyther by loue or force.” In this wicked and tyrannicall mynde, hee
returned to hys place, where his companions
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page414" id = "page414">414</a></span>
seeing him so out of quiet, sayd vnto him: “Is thys the guise of a
gentle minde, to abase it selfe to the pursute of so simple a Wench? Doe
not you know the malice of that sexe, and the guiles wherewith those
Serpents poyson men? Care you so little for a woman as she doth for you,
and then wyll she imbrace you and make mutch of you, whose only study is
(which I beleeue) to frame hirselfe agaynst all that, for which humble
sute is made: But admit, that women hath some qualities to draw men to
loue them, to honour and serue them, which if it so be truely that
office and dutifull deuoyre ought to be imployed in seruice of them,
that be honourable and in spirite and iudgement of gentle kinde, which
no doubt wil counteruayle the merite of sutch a suter: And certesse I am
of opinion that a man may vaynely consume a yere or two in pursute and
seruice of this mealy Countrey wench, so well as addresse his loue in
the obedience of some fayre and honest Gentlewoman: which courteously
and with some fauour wyll recompence, the trauayles of hir seruaunt,
where that rude and sottish gyrle, by pryde will vaunt and looke a loft,
at the honor done vnto hir, despise theym whose worthynesse she knoweth
not, and whom neyther she nor the best of her seede, be worthy to serue
in any respect: will you know then what I thinke best for you to do?
myne aduice is then, that one of these euenings, she be trussed vp in a
Maile and brought hither, or in some place els where you thinke good,
that you may enioy at pleasure the beauty of hir whom you do praise and
wonder at so mutch: And afterwards let hir dissemble it she lust, and
make a Iewel of hir chastity when she hath not to triumph ouer you, by
bearing away the victory of your pursutes.” “Ah my good friend,”
aunswered the desperate louer, “how rightly you touch the most
daungerous place of al my wound, and how soueraygne a salue and plaister
you apply therevnto: I&nbsp;had thought truly to intreate you of that,
whereof euen now you haue made the ouerture, but fearing to offend you,
or to mutch vsurpe vpon your friendship, rather had I suffer a death
continuall, than rayse one point of offence, or discontentation in them,
which so frankly haue offred to doe me pleasure, whereof (by&nbsp;God’s
assistaunce) I&nbsp;hope to be acquited with all duety and office of
frendship. Now resteth it, to put in
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page415" id = "page415">415</a></span>
proofe, the effect of your deuise, and that so shortly as I can: In like
manner you see that the terme of my heere abode, will shortly expire,
and if wee be once at the Courte, impossible it is for me to recouer so
good occasion, and peraduenture she wil be maried, or some other shal
cary away the pray after which I haue beaten the Bush.” The plot then of
this mayden’s rape, was resolued vpon, and the first espied occasion
taken: But the louer which feared least this heat of his companions
would coole, sollicited them so mutch, as the execution was ordayned the
following night: which they did, not so mutch for the pleasure of their
frend, to whom in sutch aduentures they ought to deny all helpe,
(sith frendship ought not to passe, <i>Sed <ins class = "notation"
title = "abbreviation for ‘usque’">vsq;</ins> ad aras</i>, as Pericles the
Athenian sayd, so far as was sufferable by the lawes of God) as for that
they wer of nature of the self same tramp, which their passionate
companion was, and would haue made no conscience to enterpryse the same
for themselues, although the other had not tolde them hys affections:
These bee the Fruictes of vnruled Youth, wherein onely the Verdure and
greennesse of the Age beareth greatest sway, the wyll whereof reason can
not restrayne, which sooner reclineth to the carnall part, than to that
which tendeth to the honest repast and contentment of the mynd. The next
night, they three accompanied with <span class = "smallroman">V.</span>
or <span class = "smallroman">VI.</span> seruauntes (so&nbsp;honest as
theyr maisters) gaue the onset in armure and weapons well appointed to
defende and hurt, if any resistance were made, they myght be able to
repell theyr aduersaries. Thus about two of the clocke in the night they
came to the Mil, the Heauens hauyng throwne theyr mantell ouer the
vaporous earthe, and dymmed hir Face with theyr vayle obscure and darke,
and yet not sutch, but that the ayre was cloudye cleere: and when no man
doubted of so great offence, and of sutch vnhappy rape, they brake into
the poore Miller’s House, beetwene whose armes they toke away his
daughter deare, and almost dead for feare, piteously began to cry for
help, defending herself so well as she could from those Theeues and
Murderers. The desolate father raging with no lesse fury then the
Hircanian Tigre, when hir Faucons be kylled or taken away, ran first to
one, and then to another, to stay them from carying of hir away, for
whom they came. In the end the amorous rauisher of
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page416" id = "page416">416</a></span>
his daughter sayd vnto hym: “Father, Father, I&nbsp;aduyse thee to get
thee hence if thou loue thy lyfe, for thy force is too weake to resist
so many, the least of whome is able to coole this thy foolish heart and
choler, for the whych I would be sory, for the great Loue I beare vnto
thy daughter, who (I&nbsp;hope) before she depart my company, shal haue
wherewith to be contented: and thou cause to pacifye this thine
immoderate rage, which in vayne thou yalpest forth agaynst this troupe.”
“Ah false Knaue and theefe,” (sayd the honest pore man) “it is thou
then, which by thine infamous filthinesse and insaciable knauery, doest
dishonor the commendable fame of my daughter, and by like meanes
shortnest the hoped yeres of me hir poore vnhappy father, loosinge
through thy wickednesse, the staffe and stay of myne olde aged life?
Thynkest thou Traytor, that liuing till this day (for all my pouertye)
in reputation of an honest Man, in myne olde Dayes will become an
vnshamefast and vyle Minister and Chapman of my daughter’s maidenhoode
and virginity? No knaue thinke not that I forget the wrong receiued of
thee, for which by some meanes or other, I&nbsp;wyll purchase iust
reuenge vpon thee or thyne?” The Gentleman caryng little or nothyng for
the old man’s wordes, hauyng in hys hand his desired spoyle, commanded
his Men to marche before with the Mayden, leauing behind the poore olde
Man which thundred against them a thousand bitter cursses, threatning
and reuyling them, by all the termes he could deuise, desirous
(as&nbsp;I think) to haue them turne backe to kyll him. But thereunto
they gaue so little heede, as when he wylled them to leaue his daughter
behynde them: to whome the amorous courtier addressing himselfe, began
to kysse hir, and assayed by all meanes with pleasaunt Woordes and many
sweete promisses to comfort hir: but the poore Wenche knowyng full well,
that they wente about to play the Butchers wyth her Chastitye, and to
commyt Murder wyth the floure of hir Virginity, began to cry so
piteously with dolorous voice, as she would haue moued to compassion the
hardest Hartes that euer were, excepte the Hearte of hym which craued
nothyng more than the spoyle of that his sweetest Enimy. When the poore
Wenche saw hir Vertue ready to be spoyled by one, who (not in Maryage
ioyned) wente aboute to vyolate and possesse the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page417" id = "page417">417</a></span>
same, and knewe that afterwardes hee woulde vaunte hymselfe for the
Victorye of sutch a precious pryce: “Alas (quod she) is it possyble that
the Souerayne Iustyce of God can abyde a Myschiefe so greate and
curssed, and that the Voyce of a poore Wretched afflicted Mayde cannot
be heard in the presence of the Myghty Lord aboue? Why may not I nowe
rather suffer Deathe, than the Infamy whych I see to wander before myne
Eyes? O&nbsp;the good olde Man my deare and louing Father, how farre
better had it bene for thee to haue slayne mee wyth thy Dagger, betwene
the Handes of these moste wycked Theeues, than to let mee goe to bee the
praye of those my Foes that seeke the spoyle of Vertue, and the blotte
of thy reputation. O&nbsp;happy a hundred hundred tymes bee yee, whych
haue already passed the ineuitable tract of Death when ye were in
cradle, and I poore vnhappy Wench no lesse blessed had I bene if
pertaker of your Ioy, where now I rest alyue to feele the smarte and
Anguish of that Death more egre to support, than that whych deuydeth the
body and soule.” The Gentleman offended with those complaynts, beganne
to threaten, that hee woulde make hir forget hir disordered behauiour,
sayinge that shee must change an other tune, and that hir plaints were
to no purpose amongs them which cared not, nor yet were bent to stay
vppon hir Womanishe teares, Lamentations and cries. The poore Mayden
hearinge there resolution, and seeing that shee vaynely dysparckled hir
Voyce into the Ayre, began to holde hir peace, whych caused the Louer to
speake vnto hir these wordes: “And what my Wench? Dost thou thinke it
straunge, that for the heate of loue I beare to thee that I should force
sutch violence? Alas it is not malyce nor euill wyll that causeth me to
doe the same, it is loue whych cannot bee inclosed, but must needes
breake forth to manyfest his force. Ah that thou hadest felt, what I doe
suffer and indure for loue of thee. I&nbsp;beleeue then thou wouldest
not bee so hard hearted, but haue pitty vppon the griefe whereof thou
shouldest haue proued the vehemence.” Whereunto the mayde aunswered
nothinge but Teares and Syghes, wringing hir Armes and Handes, and
sometymes makinge Warre vppon hir fayre Hayre. But all these Feminine
Waylinges nothinge mooued thys Gallant, and lesse Remooued hys former
desire to haue

hir, which hee atchieued in dispite of hir Teeth, so soone as hee
arryued at his owne House. The remnaunt of the Night they lay together,
where hee vsed hir wyth all sutch kynde of flatteringe and louinge
Speech, as a Louer (of&nbsp;longe tyme) a&nbsp;Suter could deuise to do
to hir, whom at length he dyd Possesse. Now all these flatteringe
Follies tended onely to make hir his owne, to keepe hir in hys Countrey
House for hys Pleasure. Shee that for hir Age (as&nbsp;before is sayd)
was of condition Sage, and of gentle mynde, began subtilely to dissemble
and fayne to take Pleasure in that which was to hir more bitter than any
Aloes or Woode of Myrrha, and more agaynst hir heart than remembraunce
of Death, whych styll shee wyshed for remedy of hir gryefe, and
Voluntaryly woulde haue killed her selfe lyke a Lucrece, if the feare of
God, and dreadfull losse of Body and Soule, had not turned hir mynde,
and also hoped in God that the Rauysher should repayre the fault whych
he committed, and beare the penaunce for his temerity, whereof she was
no whit deceyued, as yee shall perceyue, by that which presently doth
follow. Now whilest the Rauisher tooke his pleasure wyth his Rape, the
miserable father made the Ayre to sound with his complaints, accusinge
fortune for letting the Whorish varlet so to passe, wythout doing him to
feele the lustinesse of hys age, and the force that yet reasted in his
furrowed face, and corpse withered with length of yeares. In the end
knowing that his playnts, curses, and desire were throwne forth in
vayne, perceiuing also his force vnequal to deale with sutch an Ennimy,
and to get agayne by violence hys stolne Daughter, or to recouer hir by
that meanes whereby she was taken away, he determined the next day to go
and complaine to the Duke: and vpon that determination he layd him downe
to sleepe vnder the trees, which ioyned to the fountayne, where
sometimes the Courtier had communed with his daughter. And seeing that
the Element began <ins class = "correction" title = "error for ‘to’">to

Yealow, and Red, Signes preceedinge the risinge of fresh Aurora, started
from his sleepe and tooke hys way to Florence, whither he came, vpon the
openinge of the Citty Gates. Then going to the Pallace of the Duke, he
tarried vntill he saw the Prynce goe forth to seruice. The good man
seeing him of whom he attended to receyue succour, fauour, and iustice,
began to freat,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page419" id = "page419">419</a></span>
and rage for remembraunce of his receyued wronge, and was ashamed to see
himself in place not accustomed: and although it grieued his heart wyth
hardy speach to presume in presence of so many, yet the iust anger and
desire of vengeance emboldned hym so mutch, as kneelinge vpon his knees
before the Maiesty of the Duke, aloud he spake these woordes: “Alas
(my&nbsp;Soueraygne Lord) if euer your grace had pity vpon a desolate
man, full of dispayre, I&nbsp;humbly beseech the same that now you do
regard the misery which on euery side assayleth me. Haue pity vpon the
pouerty of that vnfortunate olde man agaynst whom one hath done sutch
wrong, as I hope by force of your vertue and accustomed iustice, you wil
not leaue a sin so detestable without deserued punishment, for respect
of mischiefes that may insue where sutch wickednesse shalbe dissembled
without due correction.” Sayinge so, the great teares ran downe his hory
Bearde, and by reason of his interrupted sighes and continual sobbes,
the panting of his stomack might easily haue bene perceiued all riueld
for age, and Sunneburned with heate and continuall Countrey trauaile:
and that which moued most the standers by, was the ruefull loke of the
good old man, who casting his lookes heare and there, beheld eche one
with hys holowe and dolorous Eyes, in sutch wise as if he had not spoken
any word, hys countenance would haue moued the Lords to haue compassion
vpon his misery, and his teares were of sutch force, as the Duke which
was a wyse man, and who measured thinges by reason’s guide, prouided
with wisedome, and foreseeinge not without timely iudgement, would know
the cause whych made that man so to make his plaint, and notwithstanding
assailed (with what suspition I know not) would not haue him openly to
tel hys tale, but leading him aside, he sayd vnto him: “My frend, albeit
that greeuous faultes of great importance, ought grieuously and openly
to be corrected, yet it chaunceth oftentimes, that he which in a heate
and choler doth execution for the guylt (although that iustly after hee
hath disgested his rage, at leasure hee repenteth his rigor and ouer
sodaine seueritie,) offence being naturall in man, may sometyme (where
slaunder is not euident) by mild and mercyfull meanes forget the same
without infringing or violating the holy and ciuil constitutions of
Lawmakers. I&nbsp;speake thus mutch bicause

my heart doeth throbbe that some of my house haue don some filthy faulte
against thee or some of thine. Now I would not that they openlye should
be slaundered, and yet lesse pretend I to leaue theyr faultes
vnpunished, specially sutch as by whose offensiue cryme the common peace
is molested, wherein I desyre, that my People shoulde lyue. For which
purpose God hath constituted Prynces and Potestates as shepheardes and
guides of hys flocke, to the ende that the Tyrannicall fury of the
vitious, mighte not destroy, deuoure and scatter the impotente flock, of
no valoure if it be forsaken and lefte forlorne by the mighty Armes of
Pryncipalities and Monarchyes.<ins class = "addition" title =

A&nbsp;singuler modesty doubtlesse, and an incredyble
example of Clemencye in hym, whome hys Cytyzens thoughte to be a Tyrant
and vniust vsurper of a free Segnyorye, who so priuily and with sutch
familiarity, as the Friend could wish of his companion, hearkened to the
cause of the poore Countrey man, and moreouer hys modesty so great, as
hee would it not to bee knowen what fault it was, or else that the
offenders shoulde publikely bee accused, offering for all that to be the
reuenger of the wronge done vnto the poore, and the punisher of the
iniury exercised agaynste the desolate, a&nbsp;worke certainly worthy of
a true Chrystian Prince, and which establisheth kingdomes decayed,
conserueth those that be, rendring the Prynce to be beloued of God, and
feared of his Subiects. The pore olde man seeing the Duke in so good
mynde, and that accordingly hee demaunded to know the wrong don vnto
him, the Name of the factor, and that also he had promised him his help
and ryghtfull correctyon due vnto the deserued fault, the good olde man
I say conceiuing courage, recited from poynt to poynte the whole
discourse of the rape, and the violence done, vppon hys poore vertuous
Daughter, declaring besides the name and surname of those which
accompanied the Gentleman, the author of that conspiracy, who
(as&nbsp;we haue already sayd) was one that was in greatest fauor with
the Duke: who notwithstanding the Loue that he bare to the accused,
hearing the vnworthinesse of a deede so execrable, said: “As God liueth
this is a detestable facte, and well deserueth a sharpe and cruell
punyshment: Notwithstanding freend, take good heede that thou doeste not
mistake the same, by accusing one for an other, for the Gentleman whome
thou haste named
<span class = "pagenum">

to be the rauisher of thy daughter, is of all men deemed to bee very
honest, and doe well assure thee that if I finde thee a lyer, thy heade
shall answere for example to eche false accuser and slaunderer in time
to come. But if the matter be so true as thou hast sayde, I&nbsp;promise
thee by the faith I beare to God, so wel to redresse thy wrong, as thou
shalt haue cause to be thoroughly satisfied with my iustice.” To whome
the good olde man thus answered: “My Lord the matter is so true, as at
this day hee keepeth my Daughter (like a common strumpet) in his house.
And if it please your highnesse to send thither, you shall know that I
do not falsely accuse or vtter lying woordes before you, my Lord and
Prynce, in presence of whom as before the mynister and Lyeuetenaunte of
God, Man oughte not to speake but truely and religeously.” “Sith it is
so,” sayd the Duke, “get thee home to thy house, where God willing,
I&nbsp;will be this day at dinner, but take hede vpon thy life, thou say
nothing to any man what so euer he be: for the rest let me alone,
I&nbsp;will prouide according to reason.” The good man almost so glad
for his good exploit, as the day before he was sorowful for his losse,
ioyfully went home to his homely house and Countrey Cabane, whych he
caused to be made ready so wel as hee could, attending the comming of
his deliuerer, succor, support, and iudge, who when he had heard
seruice, commanded his Horse to be made ready: “For (sayd&nbsp;he)
I&nbsp;heare say there is a wylde Boare haunting hereby, so well lodged
as is possible to see: wee wyll goe thyther to wake hym from his sleepe
and ease, and vse that pastime til our dinner be ready.” So departing
from Florence, he rode straight vnto the Mil wher his dinner was
prepared by hys Seruauntes. There he dined very soberly, and vsing fewe
words vnto his company, sate stil al pensiue, musing vpon that he had to
doe: For on the one side the grauitie of the facte moued him rigorously
to chastise him which had committed the same. On the other side the loue
which he bare him (mollifing his heart) made him change his minde, and
to moderate his sentence. The Prynce’s minde, thus wandering beetwene
loue and rigor, one brought him worde that the Dogs had rousde the
greatest Hart that euer he sawe: which newes pleased him very mutch, for
by that meanes he sent away the multitude of his Gentlemen to follow

the chase, retaining with him his moste familiar friends, and those that
were of his priuy and secrete councel, whom he would to be witnesses of
that which he intended to doe, and causing his hoast to come before him,
he sayd: “My friend, thou muste brynge vs to the place whereof thys
Mornynge thou toldest me, that I may discharge my promyse.” The
Courtyers wondred at those Woordes<ins class = "correction" title =

whereunto the same were spoken: but the good
Man whose Hearte leapte for ioy, as already feelynge some greate
Benefyte at Hand, and Honoure prepared for the beautyfyinge of hys
House, seeynge the Duke on Horsebacke, ran besydes hym in steade of hys
Lackey, wyth whome the Prynce held mutch pleasaunt talke all along the
way as they wente togyther, but they had not gone farre, but the
Gentleman the Rauysher, wyth his Companyons, vnderstandyng that the Duke
hunted there aboutes, came to doe hym reuerence: and his Fortune was
sutch, as hee nor any of his frends perceiued the olde man, by meanes
whereof they nothing suspected what did insue. For that cause the said
Rauisher said to his prince: “My Lord, if fortune had so mutch fauored
me, as I mighte haue knowen of your commyng into these quarters,
I&nbsp;would haue don my duetie to entertaine you, not as appertayneth
to the greatnesse of your excellency, but according to the ability of
the least, and yet the most obedient of your seruaunts.” To whom the
Duke dissembling his anger sayd: “Sir, I&nbsp;dined heere hard by within
my tents, not knowing that your house was so neare vs: but sith that I
haue met you vpon your own Marches and Confines, I&nbsp;wyll not goe
hence before I see your lodging: for so farre as I can iudge by the
outwarde parte of this goodly building, me thinkes the workman hath not
forgotten any thing that should serue for the setting forth and ornament
of this parte of the house, which for the quantity is one of the fairest
plottes that I haue seene.” So approching the Castell the Duke lyghted
to view the commodities of the place, and specially the image, for whych
alone hee was departed from his City, whereof the Mayster of the House
(dronke with the sodaine pleasure to see the Duke there) thought
nothyng. So descending into the base Court, they saw a Marble fountaine
that discharged the water in foure greate gutters, receiued by foure
naked Nimphes, and by them poured into Vessells,
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page423" id = "page423">423</a></span>
richely wrought with Damaskyne, where was an armed Knyght, lying vnder
an hyghe and broade tree, that ouershadowed the Fountaine: And hard by,
they espied a lyttle doore whych shewed the way into so singulare and
well planted a Garden, as euer the delycious and pleasant Gardens were
of Alcinoe: For in the same (bysides the Artyfyciall Workemanshyppe, and
ordinarye Trauell of the Gardener) Nature produced foure Fountaynes in
the foure Corners, makynge the Place and plaine of Garden equally parted
in fouresquare forme. Now these fountaynes watered all the fayre knots
of the same, wythout any payne to the Gardener, except to open certayne
little Conduicts, whereby the water sprange and ran to what part he
thought it needfull. I&nbsp;will heere leaue to speake of the Trees and
fruictes deuided in fiue forme order, the Laberynthes subtilely and
finely wrought, the sweete Herbers yelding sutch contentation to the
eye, as if the Duke had not respected the wrong done to the Miller’s
daughter, the gentlenesse of the mayster of the house, and the
singularity of the place, perchaunce might haue made him forget himselfe
within that little earthly Paradise. And to performe the excellency of
that Garden, the workinge hand and industry of man, holpen by the
benefite of Nature, had formed within the Ground wherein were bestowed a
number of Antiquities, and wherein the immortal voice of an Eccho
answered their talke with a triple sounde in that profound and earthly
place: which moued the Duke to call the Gentleman vnto him, vnto whom he
sayd: “If it bee so, that the rest of the house doe match wyth that
whych I haue already seene, I&nbsp;am out of doubt it is one of the
fayrest and most delectable houses at thys day wythin the compasse of
all Italy. Wherefore my Frende, I&nbsp;pray thee that wee may see the
whole, both for the contentation of our Mindes, and also that I may make
some vaunt that I haue seene the rarest and best furnished little House
that is within the iurisdiction of Florence.” The Gentleman bathed in
ease and full of pleasure, seeynge that the Duke lyked so well his
House, brought hym from chamber to chamber, which was enryched eyther
with stately tapissarie of Turkey making, or with riche Tables diuinely
wrought, vtensils so neate and fit, as the Duke could cast his eye vpon
none of them, but he was driuen into
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page424" id = "page424">424</a></span>
an admiration and Wonder. And the further he went, the greater hee sawe
the increase, and almost a Regeneration, or as I may say, a&nbsp;newe
Byrth of rare thinges, which made the littlenesse of the Place more
Stately and wonderfull: Wherefore hee greatly esteemed hym in hys Mynde
whych had deuysed the Magnificence of sutch a Furnyture. After then that
hee had visited the Portals, Galleries, Parlers, Chambers, Garrets,
Wardrobes, Closets, and chiefest Romes of that house, they came into a
Gallerie, which had a direct prospect vpon the Garden, at the end wherof
there was a chamber shut, ouer which sutch Antike and Imbossed worke, as
it was maruell to behold, and vpon the garden side in like workemanship,
yee mighte haue viewed a troupe of Nymphes (a&nbsp;long the side of a
woode adioyning vpon a great Riuer) flying from an hierd of Satires,
that made as though they would haue ouerrunne them: a&nbsp;pleasure it
was to see their gaping mouthes, theyr eyes fixed vpon the place where
theyr clouen-footed pursuters were, and the countenance of them, which
so well expressed theyr feare, as there wanted nothing but speache.
Moreouer a better sight it was to beholde the Satire Bucks, with
dysplayed throte, and theyr fyngers poynting at the hast of those pore
fearfull runawayes, as though they mocked theyr sodaine flyghte. Within
a while after ye might haue seene Hercules lyinge a Bed with his wife,
towards whom a Faunus came thinking to enjoy the beauty and embracements
of the sleping dame: But fayrer it was to see how that strong
Amphitrionian gaue him the mocke, and strained him so hard, as he
thought his belly would burste. The Duke beholding as he thought, the
fayrest Chamber of the house so shut, by and by suspected the truth of
the cause: For the Gentleman knowing the comming of the Duke, had
withdrawen his woman into the same for that it was the most secrete of
his house, and the furdest from all ordinary seruice. Vpon surmise the
Duke demaunded wherefore that Chamber was not opened so wel as the rest:
“I&nbsp;suppose the same to be your treasure house?” (quod hee) “and the
storehouse of your most delicate things: Wee pray you let vs looke into
it.” “My Lord” (sayd the Gentleman) “the place is to farre out of order,
at this time to shew your grace: Moreouer I knowe not where the Keyes
be, for thys
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page425" id = "page425">425</a></span>
morning the keeper of my house is gone into the city, and I can not tell
to whom hee hath delyuered them.” The Duke which heard the end of his
excuse, not accepting the same for the pryce which the Courtier woulde
and thoughte to haue solde it, was sure then of that which before he did
suspect. Wherfore with furious countenaunce he sayd vnto him: “Goe too,
goe too, either with the key, or without the Key, let this door be
opened, that I may see all thy secretes within.” The rauisher seeing the
Duke to be earnest, could not tell at the first Face, of what Woode to
make his arrowes, stode stil astonned, and was surprysed wyth a newe
feare. In the end notwythstandyng, playinge the good fellowe, hee went
vnto the Duke, in whose eare smilinge hee whispered (bicause he knew
right well that the Duke was an indifferent good companion, and loued so
well his neighbor’s Wyfe, as his owne:) and sayd: “My Lord there is a
prety wench within, whome I do kepe, and would not shewe hir to any
lyuing man but to you.” “That is the cause I aske” (sayd the duke) “let
vs see hir that I may geue iudgement of hir beauty, and tell you whither
shee bee worth the keeping or not.” The mayster of the house opened the
chamber dore, thinking to haue gained mutch, and supposed to insinuate
himselfe the better into the fauor of the Duke, but immediatlye hee saw
himselfe farre deceiued of his accompt. For the rauished and shamefast
maiden comming forth of the Chamber with hir hayre about hir eyes, and
hir garments berent and torne, hir stomake and breast all naked and
discouered, hir Face and Eyes all blubbered wyth Teares, lyke a
desperate woman threw hir selfe at the Prince’s feete, crying out: “Ah
(my&nbsp;lord) beholde heere and haue pity vpon the most vnfortunate
Wenche of all most wretched caytyfe Women, who shamefully and
Trayterously hath bene abused and defloured by him, whych impudently
dareth to bryng you into the place the wytnesse of hys abhominable and
wycked Lyfe.” The Duke seeing this sight, and hauing compassion vpon the
Maiden, turned his face towardes the Gentleman and hys Companyons (which
by chance wer come thither, as the Duke was entred into the Gallerie)
not with milde and pleasant countenance as hee shewed from the
beginning, but with a looke so graue and seuere, as the hardiest of the
company could not tell what to do, or what
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page426" id = "page426">426</a></span>
answere to make hym. Vpon them than began the ryghteous Prynce to vomit
his dyspleasure, sayinge: “Is this the innobling of the Bloud whereof
thou art descended, to rauyshe thy Neyghbors and my subiectes Daughters,
that duetyfully lyue vnder myne obeysance and protection? Doest thou
thus abuse the familiaritie whych hytherto I haue shewed vnto thee?
Thinkest thou that the Lawes be peruerted together with the chaunge of
the common Wealth of Florence? No, I&nbsp;assure thee, for so long as
the Soule shal abyde within my body, I&nbsp;will be he that shal pursue
the wycked wyth all extremitie, and shall not indure the oppressyon of
the pore, enough afflicted with their own proper misery. O&nbsp;God
could I haue thought that a Gentleman of my House, woulde haue bene so
prodigall of his honour, as to soyle hys Hands so filthily by rauishing
of them which ought to be required, and to dishonour them in place where
their Vertue ought to shine for generall example? I&nbsp;cannot tell
what stayeth me from cutting those curssed Heades of yours from of your
shoulders like arrant Traytors and Theues as you be. Get ye hence, ye
infamous villaynes and beastly Ruffians, the troubles of your Neyghbors
rest, and the spoylers of the fame of hir, that is more worth than all
ye together.” Then speaking to the Mayde hee sayd: “Rise vp my wench,
and on me repose thy comfort, for I promise the by the faith of a
Gentleman, that I will do thee sutch reason, and vse thee so vpryghtlye
as bothe my Conscience shal be quieted, thou contented, and thine honour
restored for the wrong and iniury whych it hath receiued of these
Gallantes.” And by and by he commaunded the Miller to come before him,
and all those whom he had brought wyth hym to assist his doings, before
whom he caused to be brought both the rauished maiden, and the
condempned of the rape: vnto whom he said: “This is the pray my friends
that I sought after, which I haue taken without toyles, nets, or
chaunting of the Dogs. Beholde, I&nbsp;pray you the Honoure whych my
Householde Seruauntes doe vnto my House, who ouerrunne the Symple
Countrey People, and rauyshe theyr Daughters betweene the Armes of theyr

Franchyze. If one respecte (whych I wyll not dysclose) dyd not impeache
and stay mee, I&nbsp;would doe sutch cruell iustice vppon the offenders
as the posterity should make report thereof. Notwithstanding it shal
suffise that they receiue this shame before you all, by seeing
themselues vanquished of a crime, which for expiation and reuenge,
deserueth most shamefull death, and to receyue of mee for proofe of
mercy, an vndeserued pardon of their fault: with condition neuerthelesse
that thou (speaking to the Gentleman Rauisher) shalt take this mayden to
Wyfe, for otherwyse thou art not able to repayre the honour thou hast
taken from hir<ins class = "correction" title =
"superfluous parenthesis in original">)</ins> and shalt loue hir
so dearely, as fondly heeretofore she
was beloued of thee, to esteeme and loue hir so mutch, as if she were
the very sister of me the Duke of Florence, who commaundeth thee for the
raunsome and redemption of thy head, presently to mary hir. I&nbsp;will
moreouer, and ordayne by reason of hir father’s pouerty, that for the
wrong which he hath receyued of you three, that his daughter shall bee
indowed wyth two thousand Crownes by him that marrieth hir, and with a
thousand of eyther of the two other, to th’ entent that if hir husband
dy (wythout heire,) shee haue wherewith honestly to mayntayne hir
degree, and the honest port of hir house. And hereof I will that without
delay a contract be made, and a publike instrument of good record
inrolled, swearing once agayne before thee, that if I vnderstand, thou
vse her otherwise, than a Wyfe ought to bee of hir husband, I&nbsp;will
deale sutch punishment and correction ouer thee, as all men in time to
come shal take example.” The Gentleman which expected no better meede
than death, ioyfull of that sentence, fell downe prostrate before the
Duke in signe of consente, and the lyke did his Companions. But the ioy
of the Miller and his daughter cannot be expressed, who extolled the
vertue and iustice of the Prynce vp into the heauens: to whom with sutch
humility they rendred theyr humble thanks, as he would doe that saw
himselfe in so great calamity, and brought to sutch dishonour as earst
they were seene to be, by meanes of him that acknowledged one of them
for his sonne, and the other for hir lawfull Spouse. Thus was the
mariage consummat in presence of the Duke, with so great ioye, and
content of all partes, as there was rage and trouble for the Rape of the
<span class = "pagenum">
<a name = "page428" id = "page428">428</a></span>
Bryde. The Duke beinge retourned to Florence, the Brute of this act
incontinently was disparkled almost throughout the Region of Italy, and
this iudgement no lesse praysed, than the sentence which Kynge Solomon
gaue vppon the Controuersie of the two Harlots for the liuing childe,
which eyther of them claimed for hir owne. And for this cause was hee
extolled aboue any other Prynce or Lorde that in tymes passed did
commaund or rule the Common wealth wythin the Countrey of Thuscan. In
thys wyse that modesty made him worthy of the Principality, which almost
against all ryght he had vsurped, and of a prayse whych shall no lesse
continue, than the Memory of man is able to extende the same from one
generation to an other, and which those that be Couetous of the prayse
of a Prince so vertuous, iust and modest, shal not cease to illustrate
and gloriously aduaunce him in open euydence, to the ende that hys like
may exercise like things, or of greater consequence, by not sufferinge
venemous and vnprofitable hearbs to grow within the Garden of their
Common wealth. Wythin the which, a&nbsp;little mildew or vntimely rayne,
is able to marre and corrupt all the good Seedes and Plantes sowen, and
grifted there before: For commonly wicked Weedes and Bastard Impes take
deeper roote than those that beare a good and fauorous fruict, for
conseruation whereof, the diligent husbandman imployeth his labour
throughout all the Seasons of the yeare.</p>

Errors and Inconsistencies</a></h4>

<h5>Spelling in the Novels</h5>

<p>Fused forms such as “thende” occur side by side with “the ende”.
Word-initial “u” and non-initial “v” are in the original.</p>

<p>Specific words:</p>

<p class = "inset">
“renowme” is far more frequent than “renowne”<br>
“alablaster” is standard for the period<br>
“Cræsus” is used consistently</p>

<h5>Errors</h5>

<p>The printed book did not include an Errata list. It is therefore
impossible to tell whether irregularities of spelling, punctuation and
typography in the primary text are unique to the Jacobs edition (1890),
or whether they were deliberately carried over from Haslewood (1813)
and/or Painter (1566 and later).</p>

<p>Errors and anomalies are handled in one of three ways, all using
mouse-hover popups:</p>

<div class = "hanging">
<p>Clear errors in the text are marked but not changed: <ins class =
"correction" title = "error for ‘giue’">guie</ins>.</p>

<p>Missing punctuation&mdash;generally closing quotation marks&mdash;is
added in grey with a note: <ins class = "addition"
title = "close quote missing">”</ins></p>

<p>A few unexpected forms were simply noted: <ins class = "notation"
title = "abbreviation for ‘usque’">usq;</ins>.</p>
